Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Nijmegen, 2Nijmegen Institute for Cognition and Information at Radboud University Nijmegen — According to a dominant theory of attentional control (Miller & Cohen, 2001), adjustments in control are made upon detection of response conflict by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In line with this view, previous research has demonstrated reduced conflict effects in response times and ACC activity to targets after incongruent as compared to congruent trials. It is unclear, however, whether this sequential effect is induced by expected incongruency (Miller & Cohen, 2001), congruency (Gratton et al., 1992), or both. To investigate this, we ran an fMRI study using a Stroop-like task with incongruent and congruent targets following cues predicting with 75% certainty the incongruent or congruent targets or predicting the target condition with 50% certainty. We observed that conflict effects in response times and ACC activity were largest for targets following the 75%-congruent cues. Moreover, there were no conflict effects in the ACC after the 75%-incongruent or uninformative cues. However, in contrast to the conflict-detection view, the sequential effect was not due to low control induced by the 75%-congruent cues because, if anything, ACC activity was largest for these cues. Invalidly cued incongruent targets elicited more activity in the ACC than uninformed incongruent targets, whereas there was no such validity effect for the congruent targets. Taken together, these results suggest that the cues induced specific processing strategies mediated by the ACC. These strategies included a widening of attention following expected congruency and a narrowing following expected incongruency. H2 ERROR LIKELIHOOD EFFECTS IN ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX MODULATED BY AVERAGE REWARD AND REINFORCEMENT LEARNING William Alexander1, Joshua Brown1; 1 Indiana University, Bloomington IN — The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is implicated in cognitive control and conflict detection. The error likelihood hypothesis suggests that activity in ACC increases proportionally to the likelihood of error, and has been recently extended to show that ACC is sensitive to the magnitude of the consequence of the predicted error (Brown & Braver, 2007). Nonetheless, previous work suggested that error likelihood effects reach a ceiling as the potential consequences of an error increase, possibly due to reductions in the average reward. We explored this issue by independently manipulating expected value of task responses and error likelihood while controlling for potential error consequences in an incentive change signal task. FMRI results replicate previous findings related to the error likelihood hypothesis and show an interaction between error likelihood effects and expected value. The results show that average reward rates modulate error likelihood effects. These findings agree with interpretations of ACC activity as signaling perception of risk. Further evidence was found to support the hypothesis that dopaminergic reinforcement signals train error likelihood effects in ACC. Specifically, the error effect in substantia nigra was found to correlate negatively with the error likelihood effect in ACC across subjects, and gambling risk taking likelihood correlated negatively with error likelihood effects in substantia nigra. These results are consistent with the assumptions of the error likelihood model, namely that pauses in dopamine cell firing due to errors may train error likelihood representations in ACC.

H3 THE EFFICACY OF EXTENDED NEUROFEEDBACK TRAINING ON ENDURING STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN THE MIRROR NEURON PATHWAYS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER Oriana Aragon1,2, Alicia Trigeiro1, D. Brang1, E. Hecht1, L. Edwards1, S. Carey1, M. Bacon1, C. Futagaki1, D. Suk1, J Tom1, C. Birnbaum1, Jaime Pineda1; 1University of California San Diego, 2Cal State University San Marcos — Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterized by social isolation, lack of eye contact, poor language capacity, trouble imitating others, absence of empathy, and difficulty interpreting intentions. Recent research has shown that the Mirror Neuron System (MNS) plays an active role in these behaviors. Therefore when people with ASD have difficulty with these tasks it is argued to be at least in part due to a deficiency in their MNS. Neural structural and electrophysiological differences are further evidence of a deficient MNS in people with ASD. There are claims as to the efficacy of long term Neurofeedback Training (NFT) in treating symptoms of ASD by reengaging the MNS and its related behaviors; however there are no rigorous empirical studies to support these claims. We conducted a 10 week pilot study to test the efficacy of NFT. In this double blind study, 19 participants with high functioning autism were randomly assigned to receive NFT or to receive a placebo NFT. Post training the experimental group successfully learned to control the power of their Mu rhythms, and showed Mu Suppression Indices that resembled those of typically developed children, whereas they were clearly deficient before the training. The Test of Variable Attention showed a 70% improvement in the ability to maintain attention in the experimental group. Scores on a parental questionnaire showed encouraging changes in the experimental group’s speech and language dimension; however the scores showed negative changes in their sensory and cognitive dimension. No trends emerged concerning participants’ ability to imitate. H4 OVERCOMING CONFLICT: IS GOAL ACTIVATION SUFFICIENT? Mary Askren1, Cindy Lustig1; 1University of Michigan — Conflict may arise either from incompatible abstract goals (e.g., review this paper or prepare for my class?) or from stimuli that provoke strong incorrect responses (e.g., writing the date on January 1). By some accounts of conflict resolution (Miller & Cohen, 2001), activating the correct goal obviates stimulus-driven conflict. To test this hypothesis, we compared performance across task-switching procedures that varied in the degree to which their stimuli engendered Stroop-like conflict. The effects of goal incompatibility were measured by comparing trials on which both task rules would lead to the same response (compatible) versus those in which the two rules led to opposite responses (incompatible). Our first experiment (n = 48) showed that goal incompatibility increased error rates across all stimulus types, reflecting failures to maintain the goal. For correct trials, goal incompatibility only led to slow reaction times when confounded with stimulus-driven conflict. A second experiment compared the performance of young (n = 32, mean age = 18.88) and old (n = 32, mean age = 71.03) adults. Increased age did not increase the rate of errors (goal lapses) regardless of the degree of stimulus-driven conflict. In contrast, age differences in reaction time were substantially increased when goal incompatibility was paired with stimulus-driven conflict. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of incorrect stimulus information plays an important role in conflict resolution, over and above that which can be ascribed to activation of the correct goal. Older age is associated with more pronounced declines in this inhibitory process.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  235  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  H5 ARCHITECTURE OF COGNITIVE CONTROL IN THE HUMAN PREFRONTAL CORTEX: A VOXEL-BASED LESION MAPPING STUDY IN PATIENTS WITH PREFRONTAL LESIONS. Carole Azuar1,2, Emmanuelle Volle, E1, Serge Kinkingnehun1,3, Bruno Dubois1,4, Etienne Koechlin5, Richard Levy1,2; 1INSERM U610, Paris, 2Service de Neurologie, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, Paris, 3IFR 49, SHFJ, Orsay, 4Fédération de Neurologie, Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris, 5INSERM U742, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris — The prefrontal cortex is essential for cognitive control, the ability to coordinate thoughts or actions in relation with internal goals. Its functional architecture, however, remains debated. Using brain imaging in humans, E. Koechlin and colleagues (Science, 2003) showed that the lateral prefrontal cortex is organized in a cascade of executive processes, from premotor to anterior prefrontal regions, that control behavior (“the cascade model of cognitive control”). The cognitive control involves three nested levels of processing: sensory, contextual and episodic controls. The aim of this study is to validate this cascade model in brain damaged patients, using a novel clinical-radiological correlation method (AnaCOM) based on the principles of the voxelbased lesion mapping. The AnaCOM method allows to build cluster-bycluster statistical maps of anatomo-clinical correlations, showing areas that are significantly associated with a given deficit in the chosen behavioral tasks. This novel approach to clinical-radiological correlation is complementary to functional imaging techniques, showing the functional weight of a given prefrontal region for a specific control function. This method has been applied in 30 patients with focal prefrontal lesions performing the three behavioral conditions described in Koechlin et al. (2003). According to the cascade model of cognitive control, the statistical maps showed that sensory control is subserved by lateral premotor regions, and that contextual and episodic controls are subserved by rostral prefrontal regions. By providing data that converge with those of functional imaging studies, these preliminary results support the cascade model of cognitive control. H6 THE EFFECT OF BILINGUALISM ON COGNITIVE CONTROL IN THE STROOP COLOUR-WORD TASK IN LATE PROFICIENT BILINGUALS: ERP STUDY Gjurgjica Badzakova-Trajkov1, Karen E. Waldie1, Ian J. Kirk1, Branka Milivojevic1; 1Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, The University of Auckland, Auckland — High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to record visual-evoked potentials from 12 Macedonian-English (M-E) bilinguals, 12 German-English (G-E) bilinguals and 16 English monolinguals while performing a manual version of the traditional Stroop colour-word task in order to investigate the effects of bilingualism on the time course and properties of the neural activation underlying the Stroop effect. Bilinguals performed the task in both their first (L1) and second (L2) language. No differences were observed in reaction time or accuracy data between the groups or languages. The Stroop interference effect was investigated at the event-related potential (ERP) level using the incongruent-congruent condition comparison. A temporal shift around the N400 time window was observed in the difference waveform for this comparison between the groups, with bilinguals displaying delayed latencies for both languages. An amplitude difference between the incongruent and congruent condition for monolinguals and G-E bilinguals in L1 was observed across a significant number of electrodes over frontal and central sites. In contrast, this amplitude difference was observed in fewer electrodes over frontal and central sites for M-E bilinguals in both their languages and for G-E bilinguals in L2. This may be taken to reflect a reduced interference effect for M-E bilinguals in both their languages and for G-E bilinguals in L2. Overall, the results show that bilingualism may cause subtle yet measurable changes in the way we process attentional tasks, such as the Stroop task. However, these changes may be restricted to one language or both, depending on the bilinguals’ language background.  236  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  H7 DISSOCIATIONS AMONG VERBAL INTERFERENCE TASKS: UNDERDETERMINED VS. PREPOTENT COMPETITION Laura H.F. Barde1,2, Myrna F. Schwartz1, Sharon L. Thompson-Schill2; 1Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute, 2University of Pennsylvania — Data from neuropsychological case studies suggest a link between semantic shortterm memory (sSTM) impairment and deficits in resolving certain forms of competitive interference (Hamilton & Martin, 2007). A possible unifying framework for findings in such patients is the dissociability of two types of interference resolution: sSTM patients may be capable of resolving interference from several weakly activated yet competing representations (“underdetermined” conflict) but unable to resolve interference when an inappropriate representation is “prepotent” (cf., Botvinick et al., 2001). We tested this idea in a case-series study with three patients, each with history of left hemisphere stroke and known STM impairment. Patients BAC, CN, and DU performed four tests that putatively tap resolution of Underdetermined (Category Fluency; Verb Generation; and a variant of the Hayling Sentence Completion task) or Prepotent (a variant of the Monsell Recent Probes task) conflict. sSTM patient CN replicated the pattern described by Hamilton and Martin, showing better resolution of Underdetermined relative to Prepotent conflict. Moreover, this pattern was not specific to sSTM deficit, as phonological STM patient BAC performed similarly to patient CN. In contrast, patient DU showed the opposite dissociation (better resolution of Prepotent conflict than Underdetermined). Lesion overlap analyses revealed both CN and BAC to have similar fronto-parietal lesions, including the superior aspect of BA44, while patient DU had a frontal lesion that extended deep into white matter and also involved anterior temporal regions. These data have implications for characterizations of STM deficit, interference resolution mechanisms, and the functional organization of left prefrontal cortex. H8 PREFRONTAL CORTEX CUE-RELATED ACTIVITY WHEN PREPARING TO OVERCOME A PREPOTENT RESPONSE Theresa Becker1, David Cicero1, John Kerns1; 1University of Missouri-Columbia — Both prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity have been exhibited during cognitive control tasks. However, there has been debate in the literature regarding the specific roles of the PFC and ACC in these tasks. One view is that the PFC exerts control while the ACC monitors response conflict. In contrast, some research has found ACC activity for cues signaling upcoming difficult trials, suggesting that the ACC might also play a role in boosting attention. However, it is possible that ACC cue-related activity might be due to the preparation of multiple responses and therefore the occurrence of response conflict. In the present fast event-related fMRI study, we used a task that does not involve cue-related response conflict, the Preparing to Overcome a Prepotent Response (POP) task, to examine cue and probe-related neural activity in 26 healthy controls. On the POP task, participants exhibited significantly slower performance during the suppression of a prepotent response. At the same time, in fMRI data, participants exhibited PFC but not ACC cue-related activity, with ACC exhibiting activity for high response conflict probes. These results are consistent with previous research suggesting PFC activity when needing to prepare to overcome a prepotent response and ACC activity only during the occurrence of response conflict. H9 GENERATING AND PREPARING FOR ONE’S OWN TASK GOALS Sara L Bengtsson1, John-Dylan Haynes2, Katsuyuki Sakai3, Richard E Passingham4; 1Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, London, 2Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, Berlin, 3 Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan, 4University of Oxford — In the laboratory the experimenter determines the nature of the task, but in everyday life people set their own task goals. We examined the neural mechanisms, using fMRI, involved in task preparation based  \\x0cPoster Session H  on free selection. On each trial we presented a word. Participants had to decide either whether the word had an abstract or concrete meaning (semantic condition), or whether it had two syllables or not (phonological condition). On some trials the participants decided in advance which condition they would perform; on others, they were instructed which condition to perform. We analysed the delay period between the task decision and word presentation. Comparing the free selection task with the instructed task, there was task set activity in the paracingulate cortex and prefrontal area 46. Common to both conditions was activity in the polar cortex, which peaked later than activity in area 46 and the paracingulate cortex. Additionally there was more activity in ventral premotor cortex (PMv) when the participants prepared for the phonological task, and in Broca’s area when they prepared for the semantic task. We next examined the correlation of activity between area 46 and PMv, and area 46 and Broca’s area. On the free selection task, the correlation was higher between area 46 and PMv when the participants prepared for the phonological task, and between area 46 and Broca’s area when they prepared for the semantic task. In conclusion, when people generate their own task goals, activity in area 46 reflects preparation to perform a specific task. H10 PROSPECTIVE MEMORY AND ROSTRAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX: INVOLVEMENT OF A SYSTEM MEDIATING STIMULUSORIENTED AND STIMULUS-INDEPENDENT ATTENDING? Roland G. Benoit1, Sam J. Gilbert1, Chris D. Frith2,3, Paul W. Burgess1; 1 Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, 2Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience & Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK, 3Niels Bohr project \"interacting minds\", CFIN, University of Aarhus, Århus, Denmark — Using fMRI, we investigated whether the oft-reported rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activations during prospective memory paradigms (i.e., realization of delayed intentions that are not directly cued by the environment) might reflect the demands that such tasks make for selection between stimulus-oriented (i.e., environmentally prompted) and stimulus-independent (i.e., environmentally decoupled) attending. Using a 2x2 factorial design, we crossed (i) prospective memory vs. ongoing task only, with (ii) stimulus-oriented vs. stimulus-independent attending, across two tasks that differed in stimulus form and background processing requirements. In support of the hypothesis, common regions of activation within rostromedial PFC were revealed by comparing the ongoing task only with the prospective memory condition, and the stimulus-oriented with the stimulus-independent condition. However, activation related to the former contrast extended more superiorly, suggesting a functional gradient along a dorsal-ventral axis within this region. Moreover, the prospective memory compared with the ongoing task only condition recruited left rostrolateral PFC, reflecting the requirement to maintain delayed intentions. Distinct aspects of this region were also transiently activated at transitions between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent conditions. These results suggest that some of the rostral prefrontal signal changes previously noted during prospective memory tasks may reflect alterations in demands made upon an attentional system that mediates competition between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent processing. However, this is unlikely to provide a complete explanation. H11 TRAINING AND TRANSFER EFFECTS OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS IN PRESCHOOL CHILDREN Sissela Bergman1, Sofia Lindqvist2, Lisa Thorell1,2, Gunilla Bohlin2, Torkel Klingberg1; 1Stockholm Brain Institute, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, 2Uppsala University, Sweden — Executive functions such as working memory and inhibition are central aspects in neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and research on early interventions are greatly needed. This study investigated the possibility of improving working memory capacity or inhibitory function in preschool children with a controlled intervention. A sample of 64 pre-school children aged 4-5 received either computerized training of working memory (n=17), inhibitory functions (n=18), or train-  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  ing on a commercially available game (active control group, n=13). There was also a passive control group (n=16) that only took part in the neuropsychological assessment before and after the training. The training was performed at the pre-school, individually on a daily basis during 5 weeks with a researcher present. The results show that compared to controls, the children receiving working memory training improved significantly on non-trained tests of spatial working memory, verbal memory and attention. The children receiving training of inhibitory functions showed no significant improvements relative to the control groups on any of the tests. In conclusion, this study suggests that working memory training can have significant effects also in children below school age and that this type of cognitive training has the potential to serve an important role in early intervention efforts. The lack of effects in the inhibition group indicate that executive functions differ in how easily that can be trained, alternatively show a need for a different type of intervention for improvement of these functions. H12 COGNITIVE CONTROL: ITEM SPECIFIC AND RAPID Chris Blais1, Evan Risko2, Silvia Bunge1; 1University of California, Berkeley, 2University of Waterloo — A popular index of cognitive control is the proportion congruent effect in the Stroop task where the magnitude of the Stroop effect increases as the proportion of congruent trials increases. Botvinick and colleagues offered an account of this phenomenon in the context of a neurologically inspired computational model. They argued that as the proportion of congruent trials increases the amount of conflict detected by the ACC decreases leading to a reduction in PFC mediated control. Control in this model is global such that conflict leads to an increase in attention to the relevant dimension of the stimulus. This type of account is pervasive in theories of cognitive control. Alternatively, Blais and colleagues have argued that cognitive control operates locally, on individual items. The present investigation assesses these two types of control in the context of the proportion congruent effect. We provide strong neurological and behavioral evidence showing that there is no global control mechanism that operates independently from a local control mechanism acting on specific stimuli. This has important ramifications for the field which has long assumed that a global control mechanism was responsible for the proportion congruent effect. This demonstration that control can operate item-by-item converges well with recent work showing that control can also operate trial-by-trial. We anticipate that the present results will mark the beginning of an important shift in how cognitive control is conceived thus necessitating behavioral, neural, and computational explorations of this more dynamic view of cognitive control. H13 NOW OR LATER? AN FMRI STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF ENDOGENOUS OPIOID BLOCKADE ON A DECISION-MAKING NETWORK Charlotte A. Boettiger1, Elizabeth A. Kelley2, Lee J. Altamirano2, Jennifer M. Mitchell2, Mark D\\'Esposito3, Howard L. Fields2,4; 1Biomedical Research Imaging Center, and Curriculum in Neurobiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 2Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center, Emeryville, CA, 3Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, and Henry J. Wheeler Brain Imaging Center, University of California, Berkeley, 4University of California, San Francisco — We have previously found that distinct brain areas predict individual selection bias in decisions between small immediate (“Now”) and larger delayed rewards (“Later”). In addition, we have found that such selection bias can be manipulated by endogenous opioid blockade. To test the hypothesis that blocking endogenous opioid signaling with Naltrexone (NTX) would alter brain activity during decision-making in areas that predict individual choice, we compared fMRI BOLD signal correlated with Now versus Later decision-making after acute administration of NTX (50 mg) or placebo. We tested both abstinent alcoholics (AA) and control subjects (CS) with no history of substance abuse in a randomized two-session crossover design. We defined regions of interest (ROI) as 10mm spheres centered on activation peaks that predict Now vs. Later selection bias (Boettiger et al, 2006). We  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  237  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  found that NTX administration was associated with a significant increase in BOLD signal during decision-making in the right lateral orbital gyrus ROI (p<0.05), an area in which enhanced activity during decision-making predicts Later bias. An exploratory mapwise analysis identified additional loci in which BOLD signal during decision-making was enhanced (left orbitofrontal cortex, and left inferior temporal gyrus) or reduced (right superior temporal pole) by NTX. Additional analyses identified a rich constellation of cortical sites, including the right lateral orbital gyrus, in which NTX effects on BOLD signal predicted NTX effects on selection bias. Our data are consistent with the dense opioid receptor expression found in frontal and temporal cortices of humans, and indicate possible mechanisms of NTX’s therapeutic effects. H14 NEURAL CORRELATES OF OVERCOMING INTERFERENCE FROM INSTRUCTED AND APPLIED STIMULUS-RESPONSE ASSOCIATIONS Marcel Brass1,2, Dorit Wenke3, Florian Waszak4; 1Ghent University, Belgium, 2Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, 3Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, 4CNRS and René Descartes University, Paris, France — One of the major evolutionary progressions of human primates in the motor domain is their ability to use verbal instructions to guide their behaviour. Despite this fundamental role of verbal information for our behavioural regulation, the functional and neural mechanisms underlying the transformation of verbal instructions into efficient behaviour are still poorly understood. To gain deeper insights into the implementation of verbal instructions, we investigated the neural circuits involved in overcoming interference from merely instructed stimulus-response (S-R) mappings and applied S-R mappings. The functional MRI data indicate that overcoming interference from an instructed S-R mapping involves the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), whereas overcoming interference from an applied S-R mapping involves the ACC, over and above the preSMA. These data suggest a functional dissociation between instructed and applied S-R associations. At the same time, they also demonstrate that verbal instructions lead to a sublinguistic representation that shares some functional properties with applied S-R associations. H15 PRE-STIMULUS ACTIVATION OF THE COGNITIVE CONTROL NETWORK IS ASSOCIATED WITH CORRECT PERFORMANCE IN A STROOP TASK Juliane Britz1,2, Christoph Michel1,2,3; 1University of Geneva, Switzerland, 2Biomedical Imaging Center, University of Geneva, Switzerland, 3Neurology Clinic, University of Geneva Medical School, Switzerland — Cognitive control refers to the ability to flexibly coordinate thoughts and actions in order to correctly perform tasks. Especially under conditions of conflict, heightened control is required to perform tasks correctly. Nevertheless, irrespective of conflict, the same physical stimuli can be processed either correctly or erroneously. In the current study, we hypothesized that heightened levels of cognitive control before an event will be associated with correct performance in that trial. Subjects performed a color-word Stroop task while their EEG was recorded from 256 electrodes. Evoked potentials were computed for correct and incorrect trials for a period of -300 to 800 ms; no pre-stimulus baseline correction was performed. At around 100 ms prior to stimulus onset, we found significant differences in both scalp topography and amplitude of the averaged response. Distributed inverse solutions were computed for each time point, and statistical tests revealed significant differences the same period of the scalp potential differences. Significantly increased activation for subsequently correct vs incorrect responses was found in areas of the cognitive control network. It encompassed superior and middle frontal gyrus, anterior, rostral and caudate cingulate cortex and superior parietal cortex bilaterally. The activity was stronger left-lateralized in frontal than parietal areas. The present results indicate that pre-stimulus activity in the cognitive control network leads to correct performance in a high conflict task.  238  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  H16 CONFLICT EFFECTS WITHOUT CONFLICT IN MEDIAL 1 PREFRONTAL CORTEX Joshua Brown1; Indiana University, Bloomington, IN — The error likelihood computational model of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Brown & Braver, 2005) has successfully predicted error likelihood effects, risk prediction effects, and how individual differences in conflict and error likelihood effects vary with trait differences in risk aversion. The same model makes a further prediction that apparent conflict effects in ACC may result in part from an increasing number of response cues, even when the cued responses are not mutually incompatible. The model prediction was tested with a modification of our changesignal task, in which some task conditions required two otherwise mutually incompatible responses to be generated simultaneously. In that case, the two response processes were no longer in conflict with each other. The fMRI results show that simultaneous preparation of multiple responses can lead to the increased ACC activation previously observed as conflict effects, even when no state of response conflict exists in the context of the task instructions. A second control task performed by the same subjects suggests that the increased ACC activation is due to an increasing number of external response cues rather than to an increasing number of internal response processes. The results are consistent with the predictions of the error likelihood computational model as published. Supported by: A NARSAD Young Investigator Award and R03 DA023462-01 H17 ASYMMETRIC TASK SWITCHING COSTS GENERATED BY TASK PRACTICE Matthew S. Cain1, Arthur P. Shimamura1; 1University of California, Berkeley — One common experimental design is to intermix trials of different types using different stimuli or instruction sets. Some tasks, such as the antisaccade task, have large, asymmetric carryover effects from one trial to the next. That is, performance on the current trial is influenced by the task demands of the previous trial. Other paradigms, such as those using arbitrary manual stimulus-response (S-R) mappings, have not shown such carryover effects. While task history and task switching effects generally have been investigated, the differences between tasks that do and do not show carryover effects have been largely unexplored. In this study, we employed two arbitrary S-R mapping tasks of equal difficulty, one in which the color of the stimulus required a button-press response and the other in which the shape of the stimulus was the relevant dimension. Participants were first trained extensively on one of the tasks. Later, they were tested with a mixed task session containing bivalent stimuli where they had to act upon either the practiced rule or the novel rule, based on an auditory cue. In the mixed block, participants were slower overall on the practiced than the novel trials. Asymmetric reaction time task switching costs also emerged, with a greater cost for switching from the novel to the practices task than from the practiced to the novel task, demonstrating that relative levels of practice are a determining factor for the presence or absence of asymmetric switch costs. H18 DISSOCIATION BETWEEN ORBITO AND DORSOLATERAL/ HIGH MESIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX IN EXPERIENCE OF REGRET AND ITS INFLUENCE ON DECISION MAKING Nathalie Camille1,4, Jerome Sallet2,4, Pascale Pradat-Diehl3, Angela Sirigu4; 1McGill University, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, 2INSERM U846, Center for Stem Cell and Brain Research, Bron, France, 3Service de Medecine Physique et Readaptation, Hopital de la Salpetriere, Paris, 4Institut des sciences cognitives, Bron, France — Adaptive goal-directed behaviour involves detection of the rewards, assessment of what we obtained in this present context and learning to predict future rewards from past experiences in order to prepare and execute goal-directed behaviour. The prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in the processing, but the specific contribution of the different brain regions still is unclear. To answer this crucial question, we tested normal subjects and both patients suffering from orbitofrontal  \\x0cPoster Session H  lesion (OFC) and dorsolateral/high mesial (DL/M) lesions in a gambling task. We analyzed the emotional evaluation of what they obtained, their physiological responses and their strategic choice. Our results showed that normal subjects were able to compare what they obtained with what they might have obtained if they had chosen differently and therefore elicited regret. From their emotional experiences of their previous choices, they learned to choose wisely. OFC patients turned out to be unable to compare their gains with the gains of the non-obtained outcome. Therefore, they were unable to elicit regret, stressing the fundamental role of the orbitofrontal region in mediating the experience of regret. From their regret experience, they did not learn and continued to choose incorrectly (Camille et al., Science, 2004). DL/M patients expressed regret but however were unable to take into account the future regret in order to change their decisions on strategies, failing to choose advantageously. This last result provided evidence of the role of the DL/ M in the integration of emotion in cognition processes, underling decision making mechanisms and adaptive goal-directed behaviour. H19 LOSING CONTROL: ANARCHIC HAND SYNDROME AND MIND WANDERING Jonathan Carriere1, J. Allan Cheyne1, Daniel Smilek1; 1University of Waterloo — We report a method for inducing anarchic hand-like experiences in normal individuals. Anarchic Hand Syndrome (AHS) patients describe the affected hand as “having a mind of its own” when it engages in instrumental activities independently of the intentions of its owner. Patients express feelings of transfer of control to the hand, as well as annoyance directed toward the errant hand. We draw attention to parallels between these experiences and action slips associated with mind wandering. For both AHS and everyday action slips, inappropriate instrumental acts lead to annoyance and are frequently disowned as “unintended.” We designed an intermanual conflict task (ICT) with test trials (the presentation of a rare target stimulus) requiring the withholding of a frequent response for one hand and the production of an infrequent response for the other. This sort of task produces errors on test trials that have been related to everyday mind wandering and action slips. Probes immediately following test trials revealed that, following errors, individuals reported feelings of transfer of control and annoyance specific to the errant hand that had failed to withhold a response. Such action slips have been associated with functional activation of ACC, SMA, and lateral PFC. Lesions in these same areas are associated with AHS. We propose that inattention during mind wandering creates a transient dissociation syndrome, divorcing executive control from ongoing action, leading to stimulus-bound behavior similar to that of the more protracted AHS. H20 THE FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY IS SENSITIVE TO THE DELAYED OUTCOME Yin-Fang Chang1, Nai-Shing Yen1,2; 1National Chengchi University, Taipei, 2Research Center for Mind, Brain, and Learning, National Chengchi University, Taipei — Feedback-related negativity (FRN) is a brain potential peak at 250~300ms after feedback. In particular, FRN has been shown to reflect the evaluation of monetary loss and negative feedback. The present study is to examine whether FRN is sensitive to “delayed outcome” or to “immediate loss”. The immediate feedback (to win 10 or lose 10 NT dollars) and the delayed outcome (to get 50 at positive-outcome or to lose 50 at negative-outcome condition) were manipulated in this present task. In positive-outcome condition, participants might get delayed-gain only after immediate-loss. In specific, they could get delayed-gain twice in every five immediate-loss. Thus, the outcomes of win and loss trials were 50 dollars. In negative-outcome condition, participants might get delayed-loss only after immediate-gain. In specific, they could get delayed-loss twice in every five immediate-gain. Thus, the outcomes of win and loss trials were -50 dollars. If FRN is sensitive to immediate-loss, FRN will be greater at lose-10-dollar trials in both conditions. However, if the delayed outcome is considered, FRN will be greater at win-10-dollar trials in both conditions. Win-10-dollar is worse  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  than lose-10-dollar is because win-10-dollar cannot provide an opportunity to get extra 50 dollars at positive-outcome condition and might cause extra 50 dollar loss at negative-outcome condition. The main effect of win-loss indicates that FRN is greater at win-10-dollar trials, which suggests that FRN is more sensitive to delayed outcome. Besides, the main effect of condition reveals that FRN is greater at negative-outcome condition than at positive-outcome condition. It might be the influence of framing effect, that is, participants were more sensitive to negative outcomes. H21 FACIAL EMG REVEALS TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP EMOTIONAL INTERFERENCE IN AN ADAPTED CONTEXT PROCESSING TASK Kimberly S. Chiew1, Timothy Heaven1, Todd S. Braver1; 1Washington University in St. Louis — Affective conflict and control may have important parallels to cognitive conflict and control, but these processes have been difficult to quantitatively study with emotionally naturalistic laboratory paradigms. We developed a new paradigm that measures emotional conflict in terms of facial expression latency to and intensity emotional picture probes. The task is an analog of the AX Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT) that has been widely used to investigate context processing in the service of controlled cognition, in typical and atypical populations. Participants were biased to automatize a high-frequency, emotionally congruent target response (e.g., frown to negative pictures). In two types of interference trials, the automatic facial expression response to the picture valence conflicted with a prior contextual cue (“SMILE” or “FROWN”). A within-subjects manipulation of delay between cue and probe allowed us to examine the impact of preparatory time on controlled emotional processing. In interference trials, expressions were slower to peak and lower in amplitude than in target and control trials. Besides providing a greater characterization of automatic and controlled emotional facial expressions, this study demonstrates that emotional interference effects may occur via emotional incongruency between probe and response (“bottom up” interference), or by context expectancy even when the probe and response are emotionally congruent (“top down” interference). These parallels to observations of facilitation and interference in the cognitive AX-CPT suggest that the present adapted paradigm may be effectively used to characterize affective conflict and control. H22 DORSAL ANTERIOR CINGULATE ACTIVITY FOR CUES SIGNALING NEED FOR RESPONSE PREPARATION David Cicero1, Theresa Becker1, John Kerns1; 1University of Missouri-Columbia — The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is thought to play a role in cognitive control. However, the specific role of the ACC in cognitive control is still unclear. One hypothesis is that the ACC monitors for response conflict. Consistent with this, some studies with a long cue-probe interval have found that cues signaling a need for greater control do not activate the ACC, with ACC activity occurring only with high conflict probes. However, another hypothesis is that the ACC is involved in boosting attention to task-relevant stimuli. Consistent with this, some research with a short cue-probe interval have found ACC activity for cues signaling a greater need for control. However, it is possible that ACC cue-related activity might reflect ACC response conflict if participants simultaneously prepare multiple responses. The current study examined whether response conflict cue processing would engage the ACC. Participants completed an fMRI task in which they saw a cue (red or green square) that indicated whether they would have to respond quickly (<350 ms) or at normal speed (<2s). Then participants saw an arrow and had to press a response key in the direction of the arrow. fMRI analysis showed that the dorsal ACC was activated as participants saw the cue and responded to the probe. Conversely, the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) was not activated during either part of the task. These results are consistent with other research (e.g., CavinaPretasi et al., 2006) suggesting that ACC cue related activity might be related to preparatory response conflict.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  239  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  H23 NEGATIVE PRIMING EFFECTS ON VISUAL INFORMATION: PHENOTYPIC LEVEL OF PROCESSING DIFFERENCES DEPENDENT UPON VARYING BRAND IDENTITY Kimberly Rose Clark1, Jody Johnson2, Jared Rossi2, Christopher Mark Wessinger2; 1Retail Forensics Institute, Lebanon, NH, 2Cognitive and Brain Sceinces, University of Nevada, Reno, NV — In many priming studies, information processing is enhanced by presentation of related information just prior to presentation response stimuli. This is known as positive priming. This processing facilitation has been linked to the initial stages of information processing. Negative priming can also occur such that processing of response stimuli is slowed by prior presentation of related material. This slowing of processing has been linked to processing of higher-order, categorical information associated with the task. Utilizing positive and negative priming we investigated categorical processing of brand logos. Since brand logos are often enhanced with a variety of episodic memories as visual stimuli they are effective stimuli that are emotionally charged and require complex processing. Such emotionally enhanced information can act to slow identification, as more cognitive processing is required to generate a categorical comparison. To investigate the effects of multiple presentations of brand logo presentations we employed a modified priming paradigm using forward and backward masking. The stimuli consisted of brand logos for different restaurants and clothing manufacturers. The data indicate that categorization type significantly influences the ability to efficiently process multiple presentations of brand logos. This effect is demonstrated by consistent facilitation or degradation in reaction time depending on the brand logo category. Increased reaction times (slower) were found for well known brand logos, while less known brands resulted in decreased (faster) reaction times. The additional time needed to properly process well known logos suggests that such logos require the involvement of higher order frontal processing regions. H24 PATTERN CLASSIFICATION OF FMRI DATA TO PREDICT VALUATION FOR PROBABILISTIC AND INTERTEMPORAL OUTCOMES John A. Clithero1,2,3, R. McKell Carter2,3, Scott A. Huettel2,3,4; 1Duke University, Economics, 2Duke University, Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, 3Duke University, Brain Imaging and Analysis Center, 4Duke University — Economic preferences, or the relative values assigned to different decision options, can be identified, albeit imperfectly, from behavioral data. One core goal of neuroeconomics is to improve the accuracy of preference measures, and thus predictions of choices, by incorporating neural data. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a pattern classification technique (support vector machines, SVM) to predict the character of decisions made by subjects in an economic valuation task. SVM provides access to local patterns of activation, which allows identification of candidate regions that may be involved directly in differences in computation. Our task consisted of two types of trials: decisions about probabilistic gambles and decisions about delayed rewards. These two forms of choice under uncertainty both share common phenomena and evince potential differences in computational requirements. Subjects evaluated a succession of delayed or risky prizes by indicating their current and certainty equivalent, as elicited by an incentive-compatible auction structure. Using SVM, we analyzed data from thirteen different regions of interest that have previously been implicated in decision making. Preliminary results identified a subset of regions whose local pattern of activity, even after main effects of the entire region were excluded, predicted whether a subject was making a decision under risk or under delay. These included posterior parietal cortex, posterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, all of which provided significantly above-chance predictions. Additional analyses investigated covert representations of value across both forms of decisions.  240  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  H25 AN FMRI STUDY OF HYPNOTIC MOTOR PARALYSIS Yann Cojan1, Lakshmi Waber1, Alain Forster2, Laurent Rossier3, Patrik Vuilleumier1; 1LabNic, University of Geneva, 2Anaesthesiology, HUG, 3University of Fribourg — Gruzelier (1998) proposed that the neural bases of hypnotic phenomena involved an unconscious and constant inhibition of motor pathways by fronto-limbic inhibitory processes, as hysteric conversion. Recent brain imaging studies have provided inconclusive data in support of this idea (Halligan 2000, Ward 2003). To investigate motor inhibition during hypnosis, we designed a go/nogo task that distinguished brain activity during both preparation and execution (or inhibition) of simple motor actions, while volunteers were in three possible conditions in a 3T scanner: (i) normal state, (ii) hypnotic paralysis of the left arm, and (iii) simulation of left paralysis. Premotor areas showed equivalent activity during preparation of movements in all the conditions, but hypnosis increased the bold signal in two networks: (i) somatosensory and medial parietal regions for left/paralysed hand and (ii) in visual areas whatever the hand prepared. Hypnotic suggestion also modified activity in two networks normally involved in behavioural inhibition: (i) a right sided network including inferior parietal and inferior frontal cortices was always active under hypnosis and (ii) a left sided network including middle temporal gyrus, inferior parietal and inferior prefrontal areas switched from an inhibitory function to a left hand response under hypnosis. We conclude that hypnosis changes the neural activity in executive frontal networks: hyperactivity of the right prefrontal cortex is responsible for a greater selective attentional and modifies monitoring process. Furthermore, hypnosis changes the task setting and rules are related to the left hand instead of inhibition. H26 MEDIAL FRONTAL CORTEX DIRECTS ATTENTION ALONG MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO RESOLVE PERCEPTUAL DECISION DIFFICULTY Michael W. Cole1,2,3, Sudhir Pathak1,2, Walter Schneider1,3,2; 1Center for Neuroscience, University of Pittsburgh, 2University of Pittsburgh, 3 Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition — Attention increases both discrimination accuracy of incoming information (Cameron et al., 2002) and the influence of goal-relevant information (Desimone, 1998). However, it remains unclear how these two mechanisms of attention are coordinated in response to the need for cognitive control in humans. We found that both mechanisms originate in a single source via different pathways. Using Granger causality and controlling for motor processing in a perceptual decision-making task, we demonstrate that posterior medial frontal cortex (PMFC; including anterior cingulate and pre-supplementary motor area) directs attention to enhance incoming information (via reticular formation and V1) and amplify goal-relevant information (via dorsolateral prefrontal and visual association cortex). These two pathways are also verified anatomically using diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), generalizing their innate connectivity beyond our study’s particular behavioral context. We conclude that PMFC plays a pivotal role in directing attention via subcortical and cortical pathways modulating early and late perceptual processing. H27 COCAINE AND EXECUTIVE CONTROL: EVIDENCE FOR A ROLE OF DOPAMINE IN INHIBITING THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS Lorenza Colzato1,2, Wery van den Wildenberg3, Bernhard Hommel1,2; 1Leiden University, Institute for Psychological Research, 2Leiden Institute for Brain & Cognition, 3University of Amsterdam — Chronic use of cocaine is known to impair the functioning of dopaminergic D2 receptors in prefrontal cortex, with negative consequences for cognitive control processes. Increasing evidence suggests that cognitive control is also affected in recreational cocaine consumers. In a set of three studies that were strictly controlled for age, race, gender, level of intelligence, and alcohol consumption, we were able to link recreational use to striatal dopaminergic functioning and deficits in the inhibition of stimulus representations and action plans. First, we found that the spontaneous eyeblink rate, a marker of striatal  \\x0cPoster Session H  dopaminergic functioning, is significantly higher in recreational users than in cocaine-free controls. Second, we observed that inhibition of return, a reflexive inhibitory mechanism that delays attention from returning to a previously attended location, is eliminated in recreational users. Third, we found that users and non users are comparable in terms of response execution but users need significantly more time to inhibit responses to stop-signals. Taken together, these observations point to a crucial role of dopaminergic D2-related pathways in the inhibitory control of perception and action. H28 THE INFLUENCE OF MONOAMINE OXIDASE A GENE PROMOTER VARIATION AND NEGATIVE LIFE EVENTS ON NEURAL ACTIVITY UNDERLYING INHIBITORY CONTROL IN HEALTHY ADULTS Eliza Congdon1, Klaus-Peter Lesch2, R. Todd Constable3, Turhan Canli1,4; 1Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, 2 Molecular and Clinical Psychobiology, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, 3Yale MRRC, Yale University, New Haven, 4Graduate Program in Genetics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY — There is evidence that a functional polymorphism in the promoter of the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA-uVNTR) interacts with early life stressors to influence an aggressive, antisocial phenotype. Inhibitory control is a major component of aggression, and indeed, recent studies combining genetic and imaging data have provided support for the influence of MAOA-uVNTR on neural circuits underlying not only inhibitory control, but also emotional arousal. However, these studies have used tasks that do not allow for the clear separation of inhibitory control processes, nor have they considered the role of negative life experiences. The present study was therefore undertaken in healthy adults to investigate the influence of MAOAuVNTR and life stressors, and the interaction between them, on neural activity underlying inhibitory control. Using an event-related fMRI design, we scanned thirty-six healthy adults while performing a Stop-signal task, which allows for the separation of successful from failed inhibition, while controlling for difficulty level. Focusing our analyses on trials of failed inhibition, we found significant differences in activation between MAOA-uVNTR genotype groups in regions involved in inhibitory control and error processing. Examination of the relationship between negative life experiences and activation during inhibitory control between MAOA-uVNTR groups also revealed group differences. These results are in line with previous reports, which suggest that the risk group fails to engage regions necessary for successful task performance and instead engage additional regions as a compensatory response, thereby resulting in increased activation. These results may also aid in understanding the mechanisms of gene by environment interactions. H29 NEURAL CORRELATES OF DECEPTION DETECTION: A BOLD IMAGING STUDY Adam Craig1, Yuliya Komarova1, Jennifer Vendemia1, Stacy L. Wood1; 1University of South Carolina — While deceptive advertising has been shown to engender distrust, negative affect, and engage defensive stereotyping of subsequent advertisements from both the same source and second-party sources (Darke and Ritchie 2007; Schul et al. 2004), little is known about the cognitive system by which deceptive persuasive claims are processed. In the present research, these mechanisms were examined in an advertisement viewing task. College students (N=25) viewed 15 advertisements for new products that varied in their level of believability (as determined by pretesting). Each advertisement was assigned to one of three categories (based on pretesting with N=180 college students from the same population as the subsequent imaging study): “high believability,” “moderate believability,” and “low believability” in regards to the advertising claims. Low believability claims might include “guaranteed to increase your energy and mental performance throughout the day” as compared to high believability, “wool socks will keep your feet warm.” Interspersed between the advertisements were 5 blank screens to prevent carryover effects from one ad to another. Participants were asked to merely focus on the screen during  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  these presentations. The advertisements consisted of a product description and descriptive paragraphs similar to a catalog format. During the session the participants’ BOLD activations were recorded for the 4-level block design. Evidence for the processing of deceptive persuasive attempts (particularly in relation to insula and BA 9 activity) will be provided and discussed in relation to traditional consumer behavior literature on the effects of deceptive claims (Darke and Ritchie 2007; Barone et al. 1999, 2004). H30 DISSOCIABLE EFFECTS OF ACUTE TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION ON DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF IMPULSIVITY Molly Crockett1,2, Luke Clark1,2, Oliver Robinson1,2, Trevor Robbins1,2; 1Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge, 2University of Cambridge — Serotonin (5-HT) has long been implicated in a range of emotional and behavioural control processes, and impaired 5-HT function has been associated with impulsive behaviour in both animals and clinical populations. However, recent work investigating the role of 5-HT in impulsivity in healthy volunteers has produced conflicting results. In this study, we induced central 5-HT depletion using an acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) procedure in healthy volunteers to investigate the relationship between 5-HT function and \"reflection impulsivity,\" or the tendency to gather information before making a decision. In the reflection impulsivity task (Clark et al., 2006), participants were instructed to gather as much information as they wished before making a decision; gathering more information led to an increased likelihood of a correct decision. Participants gained points for correct decisions and lost points for incorrect decisions. We also assessed the effects of ATD on a separate measure of impulsivity, delaydiscounting. Following ATD, participants gathered more information before making a decision, compared to the placebo control drink. The more cautious decision-making style observed following ATD may result from an over-weighting of potential losses compared to potential gains, which would be consistent with recent findings demonstrating that ATD enhances punishment but not reward prediction (Cools et al., 2007), as well as with previous theorizing that central 5-HT carries a prediction error for future punishment but not future reward (Daw et al., 2002). By contrast, ATD did not affect delay discounting, suggesting that manipulations of 5-HT affect only certain forms of impulsivity. H31 ACTIVATION OF SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA DURING TASK SWITCHING: AN EVENT RELATED FNIRS INVESTIGATION Simone Cutini1, Pietro Scatturin1, Enrica Menon1, Patrizia Bisiacchi1, Luciano Gamberini1, Marco Zorzi1, Roberto Dell\\'Acqua1; 1University of Padova, Padova, Italy — Introduction: In task switching subjects switch between two tasks that are typically performed on a set of stimuli. Switching between tasks is usually associated with a decrement in performance. It is often assumed that lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is important for switching between rules. However, activation associated with rule switching is less reliably observed in LPFC than in the supplementary motor area (SMA). The LPFC seems to be involved in rule retrieval and maintenance. In contrast to LPFC, the SMA has been consistently engaged during task switching. Aim and hypotheses: The purpose of this study was to investigate task switching performance with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in healthy subjects. We expected to find a stronger activation of SMA in switch compared to repetition trials, while no difference was expected in LPFC. Method: Ten volunteers participated at the experiment. An event related task switching paradigm was used. The ISI was 13 s, and the number of trials was 120. Switch and repetition trials were balanced to prevent frequency effects. The fNIRS instrument was an ISS Imagent, with 20 pairs of channels. Sources and detectors were positioned to record hemodynamic response in LPFC and SMA. Results: Compared to baseline the left motor cortex, bilateral LPFC, SMA and PMd were active. Comparing Switch Vs Repetition trials, only the left SMA and PMd were active. Conclusion: Our  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  241  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  results confirm that SMA is tightly involved in task set reconfiguration, while the LPFC seems to be involved in rule retrieval and maintenance. H32 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND BDNF POLYMORPHISMS INTERACT TO MODULATE COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN A TASKJohn Fossella2; SWITCHING PARADIGM Matthew Davidson1, 1 2 University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York — There is a growing body of evidence that shows an active lifestyle can lead to numerous health benefits, including improvements in both physiological and psychological health. Cognitive benefits have been found in various domains but appear to be strongest for higher-order cognitive functions, including task-switching abilities (e.g., Kramer et al., 2006). Mechanisms shown to underlie these improvements include changes in brain plasticity as a result of increased neurotrophin synthesis and release. Of particular interest in the current study was Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which was identified in animal models (Neeper et al., 1997) and has been shown to increase following physical activity in human adults (Ferris et al., 2007). We predicted that physical activity would improve cognitive abilities and, further, that the extent of this improvement would be modulated by the presence of specific BDNF polymorphisms (val/val vs. val/met or met/met of the val66met polymorphism). Preliminary results with 65 young adults show reductions in task-switching costs as a function of physical activity, with a significantly greater reduction for the participants possessing at least one met polymorphism (val/met and met/met combined). In the control condition these participants show significantly greater switch costs, in-line with other results suggesting relative inefficiencies for these polymorphisms (e.g., Hariri et al., 2003). However, the greater improvement in performance for the met group suggests that physical activity may provide a means for overcoming these inefficiencies, and could serve as an intervention to improve cognitive abilities in people with these polymorphisms. H33 FLEXIBLE CONTROL OVER INSTRUMENTAL ACTION ASSOCIATIVE AND NEURAL MECHANISMS Sanne de Wit1, Roshan Cools2, Anthony Dickinson1, Phil Corlett1, Paul Fletcher1; 1University of Cambridge, 2F.C. Donders Centre, The Netherlands — There are two types of instrumental action: Goal-directed action has the advantage that it is immediately sensitive to our current needs and desires, while habitual action is far less flexible but requires little cognitive effort. To study goaldirected and habitual actions, we developed a task that can be solved using either strategy. We found that a goal-directed strategy is adopted unless the encoding of the goals of one’s actions causes response conflict. In the latter case, healthy volunteers were able to switch to a habitual strategy (de Wit et al., 2007). In recent research, we used the discrimination task to investigate the neural systems underlying goal-directed and habitual action. We investigated the role of dopamine in these two types of instrumental behaviour by testing patients with Parkinson’s disease whilst either ON or OFF dopaminergic medication. Preliminary analyses suggest that dopaminergic dopaminergic medication promoted habitual control at the expense of goal-directed control over behaviour. In another line of research, we investigated the neural substrates of goal-directed action in healthy volunteers using magnetic resonance imaging, and identified a critical region in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. H34 INVOLVEMENT OF PREFRONTAL CORTEX IN LEARNING AND EXECUTING MULTIPLE TASK RULES Iroise Dumontheil1,2, Russell Thompson2, John Duncan2; 1Institute of Cognitive Neurosciences, University College London, 2Medical Research Council, Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge — Learning the multiple rules of a new task is closely related to general intelligence (Duncan et al. in press). Both monkey and fMRI studies suggest that new task rules may be coded in part in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (e.g. Freedman et al Science 2001; Braver et al. 2003). An fMRI study was designed to investigate learning and execution of multi-  242  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  rule tasks. In the scanner, subjects learned and carried out 12 tasks in turn (involving different stimuli, rules and response keys). Between tasks we manipulated the number of rules specified in task instructions, and within tasks we manipulated the number of rules operative in each trial block. Data were analyzed both during presentation of instructions (new task learning) and during later task execution. A sustained increase in BOLD signal for blocks with more operative rules was found in lateral rostral PFC (similarly to Braver et al. 2003), along with dorsolateral PFC, the intraparietal sulci, premotor cortex and pre-supplementary motor area. Except for anterior PFC, these same regions showed event-related activity for trials within blocks. During the instructions, BOLD signal changes were consistent with those observed during task execution. A sustained component increased gradually as additional task rules were learnt. The results show that new learning of task rules recruits frontal and parietal regions similar to those found during subsequent task execution. H35 INCREASING RELIANCE ON COGNITIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR WORD RECOGNITION WITH DECLINING STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF SPEECH SYSTEMS Mark Eckert1, Adam Walczak1, Jayne Ahlstrom1, Stewart Denslow1, Amy Horwitz1, Judy Dubno1; 1Medical University of South Carolina — Speech recognition can be demanding for older adults, even those with normal hearing. Age-related declines in speech-related temporal lobe and attention-related frontal lobe systems have been hypothesized to underlie declines in speech recognition, particularly in challenging listening conditions. This study examined agerelated BOLD activation changes in 15 normal hearing adults (21-75 years) when they performed a word recognition task that was made challenging by decreasing word intelligibility. Although there were no agerelated changes in word recognition, there were age-related changes in middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation. Older adults engaged MFG and ACC when words were more intelligible, while younger adults engaged the same regions when words were less intelligible. Across subjects, anterior temporal lobe regions were increasingly responsive with increasing word intelligibility. Declining gray matter volume within these regions significantly predicted left MFG activity, even after controlling for total gray matter volume. These results suggest that age-related structural declines in speech systems lead to the recruitment of frontal regions in relatively easy listening conditions. H36 CONFLICT AND EXPECTANCY RECRUIT INDEPENDENT COGNITIVE CONTROL RESOURCES Tobias Egner1, Caitlyn Lia2, Christopher Summerfield3,4; 1Cognitive Neurology & Alzheimer\\'s Disease Center, Northwestern University, 2Ossining Highschool, 3INSERM, Université Pierre et Marie Currie, 4Ecole Normale Supérieure — ‘Cognitive control’ describes the ability to flexibly adjust one’s behavior in the pursuit of internal goals. One well-documented instance of cognitive control is reflected in enhanced attentional performance following a difficult (incongruent) trial in conflict tasks, such as the Stroop protocol (‘conflict adaptation effects’). Another well-known example of cognitive control consists of the use of probabilistic information to improve attentional task performance (‘expectancy effects’). An important question concerns whether cognitive control constitutes a single ’general resource’ for flexible performance adjustment that can be triggered in different ways (that is, by conflict or by expectancy), or whether there exist independent, context-specific cognitive control resources. We adjudicated between these two hypotheses by devising a Stroop task where the task-irrelevant stimulus information (word-meaning) was predictive (with 80% validity) of whether the subsequent stimulus was congruent or incongruent. This allowed us to cross the factors of previous trial congruency (congruent versus incongruent) × previous trial expectancy (expected versus unexpected) × current trial congruency × current trial expectancy, in order to assess whether conflict-driven and expectancy-driven adjustments in  \\x0cPoster Session H  performance were interactive or additive in nature. The results revealed that the conflict adaptation effect did not depend on whether the congruency of a current stimulus was expected, and that the expectancy effect did not vary as a function of conflict (congruency) on the previous trial. Instead, previous trial conflict and current trial expectancy produced additive performance benefits, suggesting that conflict- and expectancydriven effects are mediated by independent cognitive control resources. H37 IS PERFORMANCE-MONITORING IN OCD MODULATED BY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AN ERROR? Tanja Endrass1, Beate Schürmann1, Norbert Kathmann1; 1Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany — Studies in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) revealed evidence for overactive performance monitoring in these patients. In neuroimaging studies OCD patients show hyperactivity of fronto-medial and striatal brain regions; in ERP studies incorrect responses elicit increased error-related negativity (ERN) amplitudes. Previous research indicated that the ERN amplitude is enhanced by the error significance, e.g. when accuracy is emphasized over speed, or when correct reactions are rewarded. Accordingly, larger ERN amplitudes in OCD patients might express their attempt to respond correctly. The present study aimed to investigate whether performance monitoring in OCD is modulated by the significance of an error. 22 OCD patients and 22 healthy controls performed a modified flanker task in two conditions: one standard condition and a second condition in which committing an error caused a monetary loss. In healthy controls ERN amplitudes were significantly increased in the monetary loss condition compared with the standard condition. OCD patients had significantly larger ERN amplitudes than controls in the standard condition. Furthermore, ERN amplitudes of OCD patients were not modulated by the expectation of a monetary loss. Our results support the view that increased ERN amplitudes in OCD patients are due to a trait-like overactive performance-monitoring system. Importantly, the ERN could not be enhanced with experimentally induced higher error significance. Thus, this over-activity might actually reflect their increased effort to avoid errors. H38 THE ROLE OF EXECUTIVE AND DEFAULT NETWORKS IN THE RESTING STATE Jonathan Erez1, Kalina Christoff2,3,4; 1Cognitive Systems Program, 2Department of Psychology, 3Neuroscience Program, 4Brain Research Centre — It has been proposed that during rest a “default mode” of mental functioning may emerge, involving loose monitoring of one’s internal emotional and physiological states (Raichle, 2001). A prominent part of the default mode network is the medial prefrontal cortex, also known to become involved when subjects experience anxiety (Simpson et al., 2001) or attend to their internal emotional states (Lane et al., 1997; Ochsner et al. 2004). On the other hand, it has been proposed that complex thought and memory retrieval processes occur spontaneously during rest in the form of mind-wandering - something which is supported by findings of lateral prefrontal, as well medial and lateral temporal activations (e.g., Andreasen et al., 1995; Christoff et al., 2004; Stark et al., 2001). The purpose of the present study was to investigate what determines the extent to which these two types of resting mental state occurs during scanning and to determine whether acclimation to the scanner has an effect on resting thought processes. Subjects were scanned while performing a verb generation task on practiced and unpracticed set of words, as well as while resting. Heart rate was measured as an indicator of acclimatization. Results show a shift in activation from medial PFC during the initial scanning sessions to lateral PFC during the later periods of the experiment. This suggests that resting thought processes are not limited to the “default mode” of brain function and that acclimation to the scanning environment may have an important influence upon the conscious resting state.  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  H39 SOCIAL CONTEXT AND PREFRONTAL FUNCTION IN PRESCHOOLERS Kimberly Andrews Espy1, Sandra Wiebe1, Tiffany Sheffield1, Matthew Moehr1; 1University of Nebraska-Lincoln — There is renewed interest in the impacts of social contexts on neural function. In young school-age children, executive task performance differs in lower SES children (Noble et al., 2005), where the home literacy orientation and preschool attendance amount were related to better working memory. Given the protracted prefrontal development in preschoolers, the impact of the child’s social context might differ. Drawing our measurement work (Wiebe et al., in press) where a single latent factor best modeled lexecutive control (EC) performance, the impact of the social context (Relationship Support, Adverse Stressors, Home Quality) on laboratory-measured EC task performance and on parent-rated, everyday effortful behavior (Interference Control, Impulsive Reactivity, Information Maintenance, Emotional Control) was investigated in a large (N=242), socio-economically diverse sample of children of 3- to 6-year-olds using structural equation modeling. The latent laboratory-measured EC factor was related to the first three dimensions of everyday effortful behavior (&#955;=.43.50). Contextual factors were not related directly to laboratory-measured EC (&#955;=.03-.10), but were to everyday effortful behavior, where Relationship Support was related to Interference Control (&#955;=.39), Information Maintenance (&#955;=.39), and Emotional Control (&#955;=.33); and Adverse Stressors to Information Maintenance (&#955;=.29). At least in preschool children whose prefrontal systems are rapidly developing, laboratory-measured EC is not isomorphic with everyday effortful behavior in the real world. In fact, effortfully-regulated everyday behavior appears to be the expression of variation in laboratory-measured EC, where this expression depends on the support provided by salient relationships in the child’s social context. H40 THE HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION OF SCRIPTS- EVIDENCE FROM FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER ’S DISEASE Christine Farag1, Vanessa Troiani1, Peachie Moore1, Murray Grossman1; 1University of Pennsylvania — While often thought to be organized linearly, recent work suggests that scripts are instead organized hierarchically. We assessed the organizational structure of scripts by examining the differential ability of patients with FTD and AD to perceive the hierarchically-organized nature of a script. Pilot work quantified the associative strength of 6 events within each of 22 scripts, allowing us to develop hierarchical tree structures for each script. We identified consecutive pairs of events from the same hierarchical-cluster (WithinHierarchy) and consecutive pairs from two different hierarchical-clusters within the script (DifferentHierarchy). FTD patients (N=26), AD patients (N=8), and elderly controls were presented a script title and two written events, and asked to judge the correctness of ordered events within the script. Relative to elderly controls (93%correct), FTD patients were significantly less accurate (83%correct) and slower in response for all judgments (p<.05) while AD patients were merely slower in response (p<.05). Within FTD, patients were significantly less accurate when presented with DifferentHierarchy pairs (80%correct) than when presented with WithinHierarchy pairs (86%correct) (p<.05). FTD patients demonstrated overall difficulty identifying appropriately sequenced events within scripts, reflecting compromised action sequence processing and impaired executive functioning. Moreover, they displayed differential difficulty with consecutive pairs of events distinguished only by their hierarchical relationship within a script; such results are consistent with a deficit appreciating hierarchically organized material such as scripts. Conversely, AD patients displayed similar performance among various hierarchically organized scripts, reflecting preserved recognition of hierarchically organized material which corresponds to their relatively preserved script processing abilities.

In a preliminary fMRI study of self-referential processing, Farb et al. (2007) demonstrated that mindfulness training (MT) improves participants\\' ability to maintain awareness of the present moment supported by a right lateralized network centered around the viscerosomatic cortices. However, the precise cognitive-affective mechanisms altered by MT are unknown. The present study used fMRI to examine neural changes associated with processing in distinct domains thought to be developed in MT: keeping information out of mind, holding information in mind, and increased body awareness. Tasks tapping these abilities were compared between two groups, one of which had just completed an 8-week course in MT and a wait-listed control group (Novices). The MT group showed task-related differences from Novices in BOLD response. First, MT participants showed increased bilateral insula activity during a breath monitoring task, suggesting altered viscerosomatic recruitment. Second, MT participants showed increased right lateral orbitofrontal activation in a cognitive suppression task, suggesting altered inhibitory control. Third, MT participants showed increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortical activation in a 1-back working memory task, suggesting altered attentional control. These results suggest MT may increase voluntary deployment of attention to enhance access to viscero-somatic representations of the self. H42 THE N2B AS AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MARKER OF MONITORING FOR PERCEIVED ERRORS IN A SEQUENCE LEARNING TASK Nicola K. Ferdinand1, Axel Mecklinger1, Jutta Kray1; 1 Saarland University — An important electrophysiological marker of error monitoring is the error-related negativity (ERN/Ne), a component in the response-locked event-related potential, visible after subjects commit an error. In a recent model, Holroyd and Coles (2002) suggested that the ERN/Ne is caused by a phasic drop in dopamine when an event is evaluated as “worse than expected” and plays an important role during reinforcement learning. In a former sequence learning study (Ferdinand, Mecklinger, & Kray, in press), we found a negativity (the N2b) in response to perceived errors (i.e. deviants inserted into a repeating sequence) showing similar characteristics as the ERN/Ne in reinforcement learning tasks. In two further sequence learning studies, we wanted to explore the functional characteristics of the N2b in more detail. We examined a) whether expectancy changes, induced by successful learning modulate the N2b and b) what kinds of expectancy violations cause an N2b. We found that changes in expectancies are directly reflected in N2b amplitude. When a stimulus appears unexpectedly, an N2b is elicited; when it gets predictable through learning, the N2b is absent and a P3b is elicited instead. Moreover, we found that only those expectancy violations that are relevant for sequence learning elicit an N2b, while other task-relevant violations do not. These results suggest that violations of expectancies that are formed by learning are detected by the error monitoring system as events that are “worse than expected”. These perceived errors are reflected in an enhanced N2b and are used to adapt behaviour to current task demands. H43 AN FMRI STUDY OF COGNITIVE DEMAND AND CONTROL DURING SKILL ACQUISITION Jon Fincham1, Qin Yulin1, Anderson John1; 1Carnegie Mellon University — The current work explores changes that occur in neural activity as a function of practice during a simple cognitive skill acquisition task that had differential within-subject control demands. Particular focus was given to brain areas involved in cognitive  244  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  control (anterior cingulate cortex, BA 32/24), problem representation (parietal cortex, BA 40/7), declarative memory retrieval (prefrontal cortex, BA 9/46), visual encoding (fusiform area) and manual execution (primary motor cortex, BA 4). Participants performed two portions of their training within an fMRI scanner, where functional images were acquired using a slow event-related methodology. The first imaging session occurred early in training. The second imaging session occurred after completion of two additional days of behavioral practice. Control was manipulated by presenting either Pure blocks where all rules were computed in a consistent direction, or Mixed blocks where rules were practiced in both directions. Retrieval, representational, visual and manual areas all showed significantly decreased activity after practice, reflecting decreased demands for each of those resources with practice. Anterior cingulate showed a more complex pattern of activity change with a significant Day by Control interaction. Activity in the Mixed condition was greatest early in training and decreased late in training while activity in the Pure condition increased slightly after training. Implications of these results with respect to learning and cognitive control are discussed. H44 GAMMA OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY AS A MARKER OF CONTEXTUAL PROCESSING OF AUDITORY AND VISUAL PREDICTIVE STIMULI. Noa Fogelson1, Frederique Bonnet-Brilhault1,2, Jeffrey Lewis1, Mark Kishiyama1, Robert Knight1; 1The Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University California, Berkeley, 2Inserm, U619, Universite FrancoisRabelais de Tours, CHRU, Hopital Bretonneau, Tours — We investigated how changes in local context influenced the ability to detect target stimuli. Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of stimuli before a delivery of a target event. EEG was recorded in 12 subjects during auditory and visual sessions. Stimuli were presented centrally and consisted of 15% targets (downward facing triangle or 1000 Hz tone) and 85% of equal amounts of three types of standards (triangles facing left, upwards and right or 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz and 2500 Hz tones). Recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a predictive sequence. Subjects pressed a button in response to the targets. Event-related time frequency analysis was used to study oscillatory activity in 4 conditions: targets after predictive (predicted target) and non predictive sequences (random target), random preceding standards (standards) and the last most-informative standard of the predicting sequence (predictive sequence). We observed a significant increase in gamma activation (5080Hz) over posterior sites, in the predictive sequence condition compared to standards, 300-400ms and 600-700ms post-stimulus presentation in the auditory and visual modalities, respectively. A significant gamma increase was also observed in predicted targets compared to random targets, 300-400ms and 700-800ms post-stimulus presentation in the auditory modality. These findings suggest that gamma activation may reflect processes associated with the contextual processing of informative stimuli in both the auditory and visual modalities.

H45 EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE CHANGE TRAINING ON PERFORMANCE AND EMOTIONS OF MILITARY AVIATION TRAINEES Marie-Pierre Fornette1,2, Camille LeFrancois2,3, Jacques Fradin2,3, Rene Amlberti1, Farid El Massioui2,3; 1Institut de Médecine Aérospatiale du Service de Santé des Armées, Brétigny, 2\"Cognition & Use\" Laboratory, Paris 8 University, Saint-Denis, 3Cognitive Neuroscience Department, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Paris — Cognitive, behavioural and emotional adaptation mechanisms are based on executive functions. We hypothesized that military aviation trainees (cadets) will benefit from a training program teaching them how to develop their executive functions (cognitive flexibility, hypothesis-generation, cognitive change for emotion regulation, etc.) to cope with highly dynamic, complex and potentially dangerous situations and with stress.  \\x0cPoster Session H  Participants included 22 pilot trainees: 11 took part in the cognitive training program (Experimental Group EG) and 11 formed the Control Group (CG). During 16 weeks, in-flight performances, anxiety and mood scores (Spielberger’s STAI-Y and McNair\\'s Profile of Mood States questionnaires) and modes of stress management change were compared between experimental and control groups. A significant improvement of in-flight performance of EG\\'s lowest ranking trainees (2nd half of the class) was observed from the beginning to the end of the training course. Compared to the CG, EG\\'s trainees mentioned having significantly changed their mode of stress management. 64% of them stated that the training program had been useful to gain a better understanding of events and reduce stress. However, the anxiety and mood scores showed no difference between the two groups throughout the study. The EG\\'s trainees have most likely enhanced their awareness of stress-signals, which would explain why, despite equivalent testscores between the two groups, the experimental group has in fact become less stressed. Future studies, that include physiological measurements of stress and additional indicators of performance, are expected to help specifying the effects of this cognitive training program. H46 PERSUASIVE MESSAGES AGAINST RISKY BEHAVIOR INCREASE RISK AVERSION-RELATED ACTIVITY IN THE ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX AND INSULA Rena Fukunaga1, Adam Krawitz1, Joshua W. Brown1; 1Indiana University, Bloomington, IN — A previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) revealed significant activation in the medial prefrontal cortex when making risky decisions (Fukui et al., NeuroImage, 2004). In the present study, we investigated the neural basis of risk perception and how neural activity representing risk can be modulated by persuasive messages. Here the IGT was modified to include conditions with positively or negatively framed messages aimed at helping subjects maximize their net scores by providing guidance about the long-term value of specific decks. We addressed potential confounds between decision-related and outcome-related signals by including a variable delay between the choice and the display of resulting reward or loss, allowing independent analysis of choice and outcome-related brain activity. We found greater activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insular regions during the decision-making period when participants made disadvantageous choices. We also found that providing messages aimed at helping subjects maximize their average score led to greater ACC and insula activation during the decision-making period for disadvantageous but not advantageous deck choices. Additionally, an individual difference measure of risk taking was found to correlate negatively with ACC activity when making disadvantageous decisions. Taken together, these results suggest that medial prefrontal and insula regions are involved in risk perception and aversion during decision-making, and that persuasive messages may enhance risk aversion in choice behavior by modulating ACC and insula activity.

Thus, adept strategic learning ability is postulated to be a contributor to academic success. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often struggle academically despite having normal intelligence. There is no known evidence regarding strategic learning in children with ADHD. This study investigated the ability of 40 children with ADHD to strategically learn important information from a text compared to 40 typically developing control children. We hypothesized that children with ADHD would demonstrate strategic  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  learning deficits. The children read narrative texts and then produced summaries of the information. Trained raters scored the summaries according to selection of important information. Our findings suggest that while children with ADHD remember a comparable amount of facts overall, they demonstrate a significantly reduced ability to strategically select important facts over unimportant details. The results suggest that children with ADHD show a pattern of decreased selectivity in learning new information. Implications of these findings are: 1) the potential for developing therapeutic intervention to train children with strategic learning deficits, 2) modification of educational curriculum to enhance strategic learning, and 3) enhancement of detection of strategic learning deficits in impaired populations H48 FEEDING AN INDIVIDUAL AFFECTS THE KINEMATICS OF A SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS Maurizio Gentilucci1, Francesca Ferri1, Filippo Barbieri1, Riccardo Dalla Volta1, Claudia Gianelli1; 1Università di Parma, Parma — Does the intention to interact with an individual affect the kinematics of a sequence of actions? We compared the kinematics between sequences directed to animate and unanimated targets. Participants in experiment 1 reached-grasped and placed a piece of food into the mouth of (i.e. fed) an individual and executed the same sequence directed to the “mouth” of a human body shape. In experiment 2 the final target of the sequence was a mouth shape placed on the individual’s shoulder or on the “shoulder” of the body shape. In experiment 3 the apparatus and procedure were the same as in experiment 2 except that the position of the reaching-grasping target was closer to the individual and body’s shape. The intention to interact with an individual modified the kinematics of the sequence. Placing was slowed down by moving in the peripersonal space of the individual as compared to moving close to the human body shape. However, temporal parameters were lengthened when feeding and kinematics landmark decreased when placing an object on the individual’s shoulder. The latter effects decreased when moving closer to the individual’s body this discarding the possibility that the human body was an obstacle during the movement. Feeding the individual affected also the reaching-grasping action by lengthening temporal parameters and decreasing maximal finger aperture. Summing up, interacting with an individual induced an increase in the accuracy requirement during the movement by affecting either the final chunk or both the chunks of the sequence according to the degree of interaction. H49 IQ AND BOLD FMRI ACTIVATION – IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH IN PATIENT POPULATIONS Steven Graham1, Ayna Baladi Nejad1, Yeh Ing Berne2; 1National University of Singapore, 2National University Hospital, Singapore — INTRODUCTION Many fMRI studies that examine functional differences in clinical populations are potentially complicated by the oftentimes lower intelligence scores (IQ) found in patients compared to their healthy controls. We therefore investigated executive function related brain activity in two groups of healthy subjects that differed only in their average IQ scores. METHOD 28 healthy volunteers (15 females; mean age 25) were divided into two groups based on their Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence score (IQ). Other factors such as age and years of education were matched between groups. All subjects performed a cognitive set shifting task (similar to the Wisconsin Card Sort Test) to examine executive function during BOLD fMRI (TR=3s; FOV=192x192; 780 volumes; 32x3mm slices acquired parallel to AC-PC). Using BrainVoyagerQX (v1.99), functional images were processed (slice scan time, motion correction, spatial smoothing) and transformed into Talairach space prior to computation of random effects GLM and group-wise analyses. RESULTS_&_DISCUSSION BOLD signal differed significantly (p<0.0001) between the groups in several regions including caudate nuclei, superior frontal gyrus and precuneus in which hypoactivation was observed for the lower IQ subjects. Further analysis indicated that the pattern of caudate activation differed radically between groups – perhaps reflecting early response planning in High IQ but not  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  245  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  Low IQ participants. CONCLUSION In clinical populations with lower IQ than their healthy controls, it is possible that fMRI differences may be due to IQ differences rather than the clinical disorder per se. Caution is therefore needed when interpreting studies of patients in whom IQ may be affected. H50 DIFFERENT INHIBITORY PROCESSES IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE Alessia Granà1,2, Nadia Gamboz3, Emanuele Biasutti2, Carlo Semenza1; 1University of Trieste, Italy, 2Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Gervasutta Hospital, Udine, Italy, 3Suor Orsola Benincasa University, Napoli, Italy — Inhibition is the ability to suppress irrelevant stimuli and impulses. It is a fundamental executive function, essential for normal thinking and for successful living. Recent studies have proposed that inhibitory processes reflect a family of independent functions rather than a single unitary construct (Miyake et al., 2000). The necessity to be more specific when discussing and measuring inhibition-related functions has been therefore advocated. The present study aimed at distinguishing these processes in a population of patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurological disorder that involves, among other problems, a decline in inhibitory abilities. To this purpose we systematically assessed whether PD, triggering executive deficits, causes a generalized inhibitory breakdown or whether it selectively affects only specific inhibitory processes. Twenty-five non-demented PD patients were compared to twenty-five healthy controls on different experimental tasks assumed to measure different inhibitory-related functions. Results revealed that PD selectively affected prepotent response inhibition, as indicated by patients’ longer times to inhibit an ongoing response compared to controls. This deficit was independent of general slowing and cognitive impairment. In contrast, the other two inhibitory-related functions, the resistance to distractor interference and resistence to proactive interference was equivalent in the two groups. These results complement earlier evidences of the non unitary nature of inhibitory functions and suggest that PD mainly affects the inhibition processes subserved, at least in part, by basal ganglia.  Linguistic processes: Semantics H51 ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL INSIGHTS INTO THE PROCESSING OF NOMINAL METAPHORS Abigail Swain1,2, Sophie De Grauwe1,3, Tali Ditman-Brunye1,2, Phillip Holcomb1, Gina Kuperberg1,2; 1Tufts University, 2Massachusetts General Hospital, 3University of Groningen — We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the time courses of processing metaphorical and literal sentences in the brain. In two experiments, ERPs were measured to the same critical words (CWs), counterbalanced across nominal metaphorical sentences (“A is a B”), cloze-matched literal sentences and semantically anomalous sentences, each of the same syntactic form. Participants judged the plausibility of all sentences. In Experiment 1, the CW fell at the sentence-final position, cuing participants to ‘wrap-up’ the sentence’s final meaning. A Late Positivity effect was seen to the metaphorical (relative to the literal) CWs. Anomalous (relative to the literal) CWs, however, evoked a prolonged negativity effect commonly seen to sentence-final anomalies. In Experiment 2, the CWs were followed by 2-3 additional words. These mid-sentence metaphorical (relative to the literal) CWs failed to evoke an N400 effect, but evoked a delayed Late Positivity effect that extended over subsequent words. By the sentence-final word of these metaphorical sentences, however, no ERP effect was evoked (relative to the sentence-final words of literal sentences). Anomalous (relative to literal) mid-sentence CWs evoked an anteriorly-distributed N400 effect and an extended Late Positivity effect. However, as in Experiment 1, the sentence-final word of these anomalous sentences evoked a prolonged negativity (relative to the sentence-final words of the literal sentences). Taken together, these find-  246  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  ings suggest that, although there may be some immediate access to both literal and metaphorical meanings of a CW, the successful interpretation of a sentence’s metaphorical meaning involves a reanalysis of its context. H52 THE NEURAL UNDERPINNINGS OF SPATIAL SCHEMATIC REPRESENTATIONS Prin Amorapanth1, Page Widick1, Anjan Chatterjee1; 1University of Pennsylvania — Little about the interface between spatial and linguistic representations is known, despite compelling arguments for their interaction. The hypothesis that relatively abstract cognitive structures, or spatial schemas, intervene between visuospatial perceptions and language is well-developed within cognitive science. However, neural bases for such schemas have not been investigated. We developed schematic stimuli based on relevant parameters and obtained agreement data on these images with a group of normal controls. We then probed for the recognition of schemas in a population of patients with either left (n=17) or right (n=17) hemisphere damage (LHD, RHD), as well as in a patient with bilateral occipital/parietal damage (EE555) employing picture-schema and word-schema matching tasks. We hypothesized that left hemisphere damage that impairs the linguistic representation of spatial relations might similarly compromise their schematic representation. Behaviorally, LHD patients were more impaired than both RHD and control groups at both tasks, while RHD patients were only mildly impaired. EE555 performed at or above the level of normal controls. Voxel based lesion symptom mapping using permutation analyses found that the ability to recognize schemas from pictures and words dissociates in the left hemisphere, with frontoparietal networks involved with pictures and perisylvian cortices with words. In the right hemisphere, common areas within the temporal lobe seem involved and may in part represent the schemas themselves. Posterior superior occipital and parietal areas do not seem necessary for this processing, supporting theoretical accounts of spatial schemas as representations that abstract away details of perceptual information. H53 THE ROLE OF SEMANTIC VISUAL FEATURES IN WORD MEANING COMPUTATION: AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION Ben Amsel1, George Cree1; 1University of Toronto, Scarborough — Current neurocognitive theories of object concept representation fall under three main theoretical classes: modality-specificity, correlational structure, and domain-specificity. Previous event related potential (ERP) studies have shown that living thing and non-living thing representations are associated with partially separable neural signals, both in terms of latency and scalp topography. These results have been interpreted as supporting both domain and modality-specific theories. To discriminate between these possibilities, we systematically manipulated the number of visual features (e.g., form, color, and motion) associated with 50 living and 50 non-living thing word concepts, as derived from a large normative data set, creating equal high and low visual feature conditions for both living and non-living categories. Relevant lexical and conceptual variables were equated across conditions (11 variables), and across 100 abstract word concepts (6 variables). Participants performed a speeded concrete-abstract decision task while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded across 64 scalp electrodes. Mean area measures, scalp topographies, and spectral power analyses were analyzed in two time windows (250-500, 500-750 ms), corresponding to previously suggested phases of word meaning computation. Electrophysiological and behavioral results suggest a complex spatiotemporal pattern of representation and computation, in which semantic feature type and domain interact dynamically during concrete word meaning computation. H54 GRASPING MEANING FROM ACTION OBSERVATION Michael Andric1, Ana Solodkin1, Giovanni Buccino2, Giacomo Rizzolatti2, Susan Goldin-Meadow1, Steven Small1; 1The University of Chicago, 2Universita degli Studi di Parma — Emblems are a unique class of intended manual gestures that carry symbolic meaning independent of accompanying lan-  \\x0cPoster Session H  guage (e.g. “thumbs up” to indicate “It’s Good”). Interpretation of an emblematic gesture may require both observation of the directed action and understanding its corresponding (linguistic) semantic meaning. Another type of directed action, grasping, does not have a direct linguistic association, and may rely more on visual and spatial information of the scene to understand. In an event-related fMRI experiment using spiral BOLD acquisition at 3T we investigated the differential neural response to (a) hand observation when used for symbolic representation (emblems) versus transitive goal-directed action (grasping actions); and (b) expression of symbolic meaning with manual gestures (emblems) compared to oral speech (language). Participants were presented with video clips of an actor performing emblematic gestures, grasping of common objects, and audiovisual speech corresponding to an emblem. Whole-brain group analyses suggest both shared and differential responses across conditions. Although observing both emblems and grasping activated visual motion areas and dorsal premotor cortex more than speech, observing emblems but not grasping activated right intraparietal sulcus and right supramarginal gyrus. Importantly, activation of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus and gyrus was common across conditions, while the right anterior superior temporal gyrus was active uniquely for emblems and speech. These results suggest that unlike grasping movements, emblematic gestures carry unique semantic meaning and activate shared cortical language areas involved in interpreting these same meanings when they are presented as audiovisual speech. H55 LESIONS TO MOTOR CORTEX AFFECT WORD-PICTURE MATCHING WHEN BODY PARTS ARE INVOLVED Analia Arevalo1, Nina Dronkers1,2; 1Center for Aphasia and Related Disorders, VA Northern California Health Care System, Martinez, CA, 2University of California, Davis, and University of California, San Diego — Embodiment theory has suggested that mental imagery and observations of actions may recruit motor and pre-motor regions of cortex normally associated with action execution. To our knowledge, only one study (Arévalo et al., 2007) has evaluated the effect of motor and pre-motor lesions on the processing of linguistic stimuli involving body parts. In this study, we asked whether word-picture matching would be affected by motor/pre-motor lesions when body parts were involved. A group of twenty-one patients with left-hemisphere strokes and a group of ten controls were asked to match pictures and words of objects and actions involving the use of either the hand, mouth, foot, or neutral items. Relative to control participants, the patient group made significantly more errors on items involving body parts relative to neutral items, particularly involving the hand and foot. The control group, while at ceiling for both types of stimuli, showed a reaction time advantage for body part items. Results suggest that motor associations to body parts may facilitate lexical semantic processing in neurologically-intact individuals while introducing a dimension of difficulty in patients with brain injuries. Furthermore, voxel-based lesion symptom analyses revealed that motor/pre-motor patients had more difficulty with hand and foot items than did patients without such lesions. Together, these findings support the notion that motor and premotor areas do play a role in the processing of semantic information. H56 HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES IN FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE PROCESSING AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY STUDY USING DIVIDED VISUAL FIELD PARADIGM. Yossi Arzouan1, Abraham Goldstein1,2, Miriam Faust1,2; 1Gonda Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University, Israel, 2Bar-Ilan University, Israel — To investigate the distinct roles of the left (LH) and right (RH) hemispheres in processing metaphoric expressions, we selectively controlled the order of hemisphere processing through the application of the divided visual field paradigm (DVF). In the current study, electrophysiology signals were recorded from twenty nine right handed native Hebrew speakers, while the semantically judges 240 two-words Hebrew expressions that consisted of  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  four categories: Unrelated: “window joke”, Literal: “new day”, conventional metaphors (CM): “bright student”, and novel (NM) metaphors expressions drawn from poetry texts: “crystal river”. The analyses of behavioral measures and Language related ERP (event related potentials) components showed that the hemispheres are differently engaged during the comprehension of NM. The behavioral findings indicate that direct projection of NM to the RH resulted in more accurate and faster responses as compared to those projected to the LH. The N400 amplitude elicited by NM presented to the RH was larger than that for LH. And the latency-to-peak of the P600 component was modulated by visual filed of presentations only for figurative (CM and NM) stimuli. A faster semantic encoding time was obtained in the RH for CM pairs that were familiar but semantically unrelated than for NM pairs that were both unfamiliar and semantically unrelated. For LH presentation, latency-to-peak of the P600 component for CM and NM did not differ. This implies that as compared with CM, the RH role in NM processing required extended processing time that could reflect expression -level integration and memory retrieval. H57 COMPUTING AND RECOMPUTING DISCOURSE MODELS: AN ERP STUDY. Giosuè Baggio1, Michiel van Lambalgen3, Peter Hagoort1,2; 1 F.C. Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Radboud University Nijmegen, 2Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, 3Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam — While syntactic reanalysis has been extensively investigated in psycholinguistics, little is known about reanalysis in the discourse-semantic domain. We used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to keep track of semantic processes involved in understanding short narratives such as \"The girl was writing a letter when her friend spilled coffee on the paper\". We hypothesize that these sentences are interpreted in two steps: (1) when the progressive clause is processed, a discourse model in which the goal state will be attained (a complete letter) is computed; (2) when the subordinate clause is processed, the initial representation is recomputed to the effect that, in the final discourse structure, the goal state cannot be satisfied. Critical sentences elicited larger sustained anterior negativities (SANs) compared to controls, starting around 400 ms after the onset of the sentence-final word and lasting for approximately 400 ms. The amplitude of the SAN is correlated with the frequency with which participants, in an off-line button-press task, responded that the goal state was not attained. Our findings suggest that the human brain supports some form of non-monotonic computation in order to integrate information which invalidates previously held assumptions. H58 VOXEL-BASED LESION ANALYSIS OF CATEGORY-SPECIFIC NAMING DEFICITS Juliana Baldo1, Analia Arevalo1, David Wilkins1, Nina Dronkers1,2,3; 1VA Northern California Health Care System, 2University of California, Davis, 3University of California, San Diego — Case studies have reported individual patients who show striking dissociations in their ability to name items from distinct categories (e.g., living versus non-living things). Functional neuroimaging studies have attempted to delineate the brain basis of such category dissociations. Some of these studies have reported specific brain regions associated with discrete categories, while other studies have reported largely overlapping networks. In the current study, we analyzed naming performance in a large group of left hemisphere patients (n=92), using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) to identify brain regions associated with specific categories of items (animals vs. tools, natural kinds vs. artifacts, manipulable vs. non-manipulable items). The VLSM maps were largely overlapping for the six categories, with significant regions in left anterior temporal, inferior temporal, middle temporal, and superior temporal cortex. A few dissociations were apparent, however, such as larger regions of significance in the posterior middle temporal gyrus for artifacts and tools. We also examined our dataset for individuals demonstrating a dissociation, defined as a 40% difference in naming across two categories. Out of 92  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  247  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  patients, there were four individuals who met this criterion: One patient who was relatively impaired at naming animals and natural kinds, two patients who were impaired at naming artifacts, and one who was impaired at naming tools. These findings suggest that a network of regions within the left temporal lobe is critical for naming across different semantic and feature-based categories but that individual patients can be shown to exhibit both behavioral and neural dissociations across item categories. H59 ARE WORD MEANINGS “WEBS OF SENSATIONS”? COUNTEREVIDENCE FROM AN FMRI STUDY OF MOTION AND NON-MOTION WORDS. Marina Bedny1,2, Alfonso Caramazza3, Emily Grossman4, Alvaro Pascual-Leone1, Rebecca Saxe2; 1Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 2Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 3Harvard University, 4University of California, Irvine — How are the meanings of words organized in the mind and brain? According to the sensory-motor hypothesis word meanings are distributed throughout the sensory-motor cortices through which they were acquired. For example, the meaning of the word “kick” is partially represented in the visual motion regions activated during the observation of kicking. An alternative proposal suggests that word meanings are abstracted away from specific sensory-motor experiences. To distinguish between these hypotheses we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize brain regions involved in perception of motion and body movement, and investigated the response of these regions during word comprehension. Participants made relatedness judgments on word-pairs from six categories (action, thought, change-of-state, and bodily-function verbs; nouns referring to animals, tools and inanimate natural kinds) that varied in their association with motion and body movements, as previously determined in a behavioral study. Critically, none of the visual motion areas responded more to high-motion than low-motion words. We replicated previous findings showing greater activity in posterior-lateral-temporal cortices for action-verbs than for animal names. However, regions that responded to action verbs did not overlap with motion perception regions, and did not respond more to-high-motion than-low-motion words. We conclude that word meanings are abstracted away from their associated sensory experiences. H60 CROSS-MODAL PRIMING BETWEEN THE GESTURE AND THE LANGUAGE MEANING SYSTEMS Paolo Bernardis1, Elena Salillas2, Nicoletta Caramelli3; 1Scuola Superiore di Studi Umanistici, University of Bologna, Italy, 2University of Trieste, Italy, 3University of Bologna, Italy — Aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between the gesture and the language meaning systems at both the behavioural and the neuro-physiological levels. By means of a priming paradigm, two groups of fifteen participants each were presented with forty video-clips of different types of iconic gestures followed by the target words (nouns or verbs), which could be related or unrelated in meaning to the priming gestures. The meaning of half of the forty gestures referred to objects (nouns), while the other half referred to actions (verbs). In the first group of participants RTs were recorded. In the second group ERPs time-locked to the presentation of the target word were recorded. Behavioral results showed an interference effect between the meaning of iconic gestures and that of words when their meanings mismatched. The analysis of ERPs showed two main results: a modulation produced by the type of word (noun vs verb) and an effect of meaning. Compared with the data reported in the literature, nouns and verbs revealed a reversed pattern of results. Nouns generated a stronger P200 than verbs in the frontal electrodes of the right hemisphere, and verbs generated a stronger N400-like component in the frontal, central, and parietal electrodes of the right hemisphere. The N400-like component generated by the meaning factor, highlighted the interaction between the meanings of the gesture and language systems with the scalp distribution showing a localization of the  248  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  generators different from that producing the classical N400 with only verbal stimuli H61 DISCOURSE AND SENTENCE CONTEXTS MODULATE SEMANTIC PRIMING DURING SPOKEN LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION: AN ERP STUDY Megan A. Boudewyn1,2, C. Christine Camblin3, Peter C. Gordon4, Tamara Y. Swaab1,2; 1University of California, Davis, 2Center for Mind and Brain, University of California, Davis, 3Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies, CSU, Monteray Bay, 4UNC Chapel Hill — This study examined the effects of associative priming in discourse and sentence contexts when participants listened to naturally produced connected speech. In the discourse context experiment, we aurally presented short, three-sentence passages that were created from associative word pairs culled from existing norms. The terminal word in the third sentence varied in terms of overall discourse congruence and lexical association with a preceding prime word (e.g., “Luckily Ben had picked up some salt and pepper/basil”), preceded either by a context in which Ben was preparing marinara sauce (congruent discourse) or dealing with an icy walkway (incongruent discourse). Within a stimulus set, final sentences were identical up until the critical word, and were locally congruent when read in isolation. The preceding discourse context, however, made the critical final word congruous or incongruous at the discourse level. In the sentence context study participants were presented with only the final sentences of the previously described stimuli. In this experiment, all the sentence-final words were congruent, but associated or not with a preceding word in the sentential context. In the discourse context experiment ERP results show early main effects of discourse congruence, and delayed effects of association. In the sentence context study the effects of association were also strongly modulated, this time by the sentential context. These results are consistent with the idea that both discourse and sentence contexts have robust effects on lexical association during normal spoken language comprehension. H62 “GRASPING AN IDEA”: PATTERN OF CORTICAL ACTIVATION DURING PROCESSING OF IDIOMS COMPOSED OF ACTION WORDS Véronique Boulenger1,2, Olaf Hauk1, Friedemann Pulvermüller1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, 2L2C2 - Institut des Sciences Cognitives CNRS/UCBL, Bron, France — The cortical language system has been recently proposed to be intimately interwoven with the sensory-motor system. Neuroimaging studies have indeed shown activation of motor and premotor cortex during processing of action-related words and sentences. However, the crucial question regarding how action-related language is processed at a more abstract level has not been addressed. In the present study, we used event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine the pattern of activation during the reading of IDIOMATIC and LITERAL sentences that include ARM- and LEG-related action words. A common fronto-temporal network was involved in processing both sentence types, with IDIOMS eliciting greater activity than LITERAL sentences, especially in the left inferior frontal and middle temporal cortex and in the right cerebellum. Importantly, and crucial for this study, regions along the motor strip were somatotopically activated during IDIOMATIC as well as LITERAL reading, depending on which body part the embedded action words referred to. While ARM-related sentences recruited lateral motor/premotor areas, activity in more dorsal areas was observed for LEG-related sentences. Interestingly, this semantic somatotopy was shown for both IDIOMATIC and LITERAL sentences in the premotor cortex, while it emerged only for LITERAL sentences in the motor cortex along the central sulcus. Overall, these results demonstrate that the motor system is involved in the understanding of action words even at an abstract IDIOMATIC level, possibly reflecting its involvement in representing aspects of word and sentence meaning.  \\x0cPoster Session H  H63 INTEGRATING NOVEL VS. FAMILIAR MEANINGS: N400 SUPPORT FOR AN EMBODIED VIEW OF LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION Dorothee J. Chwilla1; 1NICI Radboud University Nijmegen — We demonstrated (Chwilla et al. 2007) that novel meanings not stored in long-term memory are immediately integrated into sentential context and that N400 is sensitive to these novel meanings. The N400 effect to novel meanings that are not associatively and/or semantically related and were matched to novel senseless contexts in terms of familiarty and semantic relatedness by LSA, support embodied theories and challenge abstract symbol theories of meaning that can only discover meaningfulness by consulting stored symbolic knowledge. The N400 effect reveals that there is also knowledge not stored in semantic memory but that nevertheless affects the ease with which the meaning of a sentence is captured. This information is stored in the knowledge that we have about our body. To access and retrieve embodied knowledge, we have to project ourselves into a situation and simulate the perceptual and action details required by a situation. In the present experiment I used N400 to directly compare the integration of novel sensible meanings with the integration of familiar meanings in the same subjects. Context-setting sentences were followed by a test sentence to which ERPs were recorded that described a familiar situation, a novel sensible situation or a novel senseless situation (e.g., “After wading barefoot in the lake, Erik used his towel/shirt/glasses to dry his feet.”). The main result was that next to the standard N400 effect to familiar meanings again an N400 effect to novel sensible meanings was obtained. The ERP data are discussed within the embodied framework of language comprehension. H64 EMOTIONAL VALENCE AND SEMANTIC NEIGHBORHOOD Hila Cohen1, Avishai Henik1; 1Zlotowski Center for Neuroscience, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev — Research has shown that the emotional valence of words affects their processing. For example, in a lexical decision task it was found that emotional words are processed faster than neutral ones. However, the negative information which arises from the negative words draws more attention and is processed more thoroughly. This raises the question whether a word\\'s valence influences its spreading of activation in the semantic network. In the current study, participants were asked to memorize positive or negative words, with a large or small number of associative neighbors (N), for a subsequent recognition test (did this word appear in the previous list or not). The types of miss and false alarm (FA) errors for words with large and small N were tested, with N as an indication for spreading of activation in the semantic network. It was found that there was no influence of N on negative words. However, for positive words with large N there were more misses and less FA mistakes (i.e., more “No” responses) than for words with small N. It seems that for positive words there was an automatic spreading of activation in the semantic network, which wasn’t controlled or filtered. This activation disturbed the participants\\' certainty that the word was previously presented to them. For negative words the automatic spreading of activation in the semantic network was controlled and filtered. This leads to the conclusion that the emotional valence of words influences their processing in the semantic network. H65 IS ACCESS TO WORD MEANING OBLIGATORY? AN FMRI STUDY OF TASK EFFECTS ON SEMANTIC ACTIVATION AND REPETITION PRIMING OF SPOKEN WORDS Matthew H. Davis1, Beth Parkin1, Jack C. Rogers1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Scienecs Unit, Cambridge — Neuropsychological deficits following stroke suggest a role for posterior inferior temporal regions in comprehension of spoken language. However, though these regions activate for written words, fMRI evidence for their role in spoken word recognition is mixed. Here we test the hypothesis that infero-temporal contributions to word meaning processing are task dependent. Eighteen participants were scanned using sparse imaging on a 3T Siemens MRI system while making phonological  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  (one/two syllables), semantic (living/non-living) or auditory (normal/ attenuated presentation) decisions on spoken concrete nouns. These three language tasks were separated into different scanning runs alternating with a non-linguistic baseline task matched for stimulus-response characteristics (speech-envelope, speech-spectrum buzz/noise discrimination). Presentation of words compared to non-speech baseline elicited increased activity in bilateral regions along the middle/superior temporal gyri, equivalent for all three tasks. Although, weak inferior frontal and fusiform activation was observed during acoustic decisions, this activation was significantly elevated during both semantic and phonological decisions confirming the task-dependence of inferior temporal responses to spoken words. In a second scanning phase, the same language tasks were performed with words heard previously and novel words. Semantic judgements showed significant repetition priming for words on which semantic or phonological decisions had been made previously, though not for words presented for auditory decisions. This behavioral pattern is reminiscent of neural activity during the initial scanning phase, suggesting a link between inferior temporal activity, access to meaning and subsequent repetition priming. This hypothesis will be tested using univariate and multivariate analysis of fMRI data from the second scanning phase. H66 THE HUMAN MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM AND ACTION WORD MEANING REPRESENTATIONS: AN FMRI STUDY Greig de Zubicaray1, Natasha Postle1, Katie McMahon1, Matthew Meredith1, Roderick Ashton1; 1University of Queensland, Australia — In monkeys, a class of visuomotor neurons called mirror neurons fire when actions are both executed and observed. They are proposed to provide a neural mechanism for understanding the actions of others. A homologous mirror neuron system (MNS) is also thought to exist in humans. Neuroimaging evidence to date indicates this MNS comprises two important nodes for hand/finger actions: Brodmann area (BA) 44 in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) - considered a homologue of monkey area F5, and the anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL). Recently, it has been proposed that the MNS might play a key role in the processing of action word meanings. We tested this hypothesis using fMRI. Participants first silently read words associated with hand actions or actions associated with other effectors, concrete words unrelated to body parts, and phonologically regular nonwords. A baseline condition involving viewing visual characters (hashes) was also included. Next, participants viewed then imitated simple intransitive hand movements to locate the aforementioned nodes of the MNS. Our results indicate that the left hemisphere BA44 and aIPL regions involved in executing and observing hand movements do not show differential activation during perception of words associated with hand actions compared to other classes of lexical stimuli. However, effectorrelated words, unrelated words and non-words all showed increased activation compared to hashes in BA44, consistent with prior research on lexical processing in this region. We conclude that the human MNS is unlikely to be a key neural mechanism responsible for processing of action word meanings. H67 LOGICAL SEMANTICS IN LANGUAGE PROCESSING: AN ERP STUDY John Drury1, Veena Dwivedi2, Karsten Steinhauer1; 1McGill University, 2Brock University — Event-related potentials have been used (Shao & Neville 1998/Drenhaus et al. 2006) to study the processing of negative polarity items (NPIs) – i.e., words like \"ever\" or \"any\" which must be licensed by the occurrence of certain logical-operators (e.g., negation: John hadn\\'t/*had EVER arrived). However, these first studies confounded [+/--violation] with lexical/contextual variables and yielded inconsistent results (LAN-P600/N400-P600, respectively). Our previous work (Steinhauer et al. 2007) controlled for both factors and showed unlicensed NPIs elicit P600s followed by late LANs (\"L-LANs\"), a pattern that Shao & Neville also report for cases of logical contradiction, and which we have found for another case of logical-semantic anomaly (i.e., the  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  249  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  \"Definiteness-Effect\": There was A/*THE man in the room; Drury et al. 2006). However, we also found an N400-effect for the complex NPI \"atall\", but not for simplex NPIs \"ever/any\" (note: Drenhaus et al\\'s N400 findings were for the morphologically complex German NPI \"jemals\" = \"ever-time\"). Here we focus on complex NPI/non-NPI contrasts (e.g., \"John thought there was SOMEBODY/*ANYBODY in the room\"). Also, we examine three theoretically distinct kinds of NPI-licensing operators, (negation/yes-no-questions/\"only\", e.g., John didn\\'t think.../Did John think.../Only John thought...there was SOMBODY/ANYBODY...) as well as cases of the DE (e.g., \"...there was SOMEBODY/*EVERYBODY in the room\") to replicate the P600/L-LAN pattern for both the DE and unlicensed-NPIs within-subjects. The results of past studies and the present (ongoing) experiment will be discussed in terms of what we may hope to learn about the neurocognitive bases of sentence-level logical-semantic processing from ERP studies. H68 THE PROCESSING OF PICTURES AND WORDS DURING A SEMANTIC GENERATION TASK: EVIDENCE FOR A GRADED SEMANTIC STORE Carrie Esopenko1, Ron Borowsky1,2, Jacqueline Cummine1, Gordon Sarty1; 1Cognitive Neuroimaging Lab, University of Saskatchewan, 2Division of Neurosurgery, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan — We examined semantic processing of objects presented in picture and word format, both behaviourally and neuroanatomically. Neuroanatomical research has shown that semantic processing of actionrelated language activates the premotor, motor, and sensory cortices somatotopically during a variety of tasks (e.g. Tettamanti et al., 2005; Hauk et al., 2004). Behavioural research has shown a response advantage in lexical decision for words with complex semantic representations (i.e., multiple definitions) that diminishes with decreased semantic complexity (e.g., Borowsky & Masson, 1996; Pexman, et a., 2002). Experiment 1 used fMRI to examine somatotopically organized activation in the premotor cortex for an overt semantic generation task (“describe how would you interact with this”) using picture or word stimuli that naturally involve either arm or leg interactions. Experiment 2 evaluated whether the semantic generation response times for pictures and words produce a semantic complexity advantage (i.e., faster reaction times for more complex objects). Results for Experiment 1 are in keeping with previous research in showing that semantic processing related to object interaction involves the motor, premotor and sensory cortices in a somatotopic fashion, and are novel in that there are unique and shared regions of activation for pictures and words that differ across arm and leg stimuli. Experiment 2 demonstrated that objects presented in word format produce a complexity advantage, whereas there was no complexity relationship for objects presented in picture format. These results support the notion of graded semantics (e.g.,Plaut, 2002), as opposed to strictly amodal (Caramazza et al., 1990) or modular (Shallice, 1988) semantic representations. H69 INCREMENTAL LEARNING OF WORDS IN CONTEXT:EFFECTS ON MFN, N3 & N400 EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS Gwen Frishkoff1, Charles Perfetti1; 1University of Pittsburgh — Word knowledge is acquired gradually, over many exposures. Thus, at any time, a learner may have graded and incomplete knowledge of meanings for some words. To examine incremental learning of word meanings, we presented rare words (such as “kippage”) in several sentence contexts. Each word was assigned to contexts that were either highly semantically constraining, providing strong cues to the target word meaning, or low constraint, that is, relatively uninformative with respect to the target word meaning. After each sentence, the target word appeared with a cue to respond: subjects were asked to generate a synonym for the target at the cue. To probe immediate and delayed effects of learning, ERPs recorded during learning and were time-locked to words presented just before each sentence, immediately after the sentence, and in isolation, after a 30minute delay. Individual knowledge of words meanings was tested  250  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  before and after training, using a multiple choice synonym-judgment task. Pre- and post-test assessments showed a ceiling effect for familiar words, as expected. Rare words that appeared in high-constraint contexts showed greater gains than words that appeared in low-constraint contexts. During the training task, words that appeared in high vs. low constraint contexts evoked an enhanced left anterior N3 and a reduced MFN. In the delayed post-task, there was N400 reduction for trained words that occurred in high-constraint contexts. We suggest that frontal MFN effects may index early stages of learning, while N400 effects may indicate robust learning of new words. H70 REPLICATING THE RECOGNITION POTENTIAL IN A SENTENCE PARADIGM Linzi Gibson1, Lindsay Daniels1, Joseph Dien1; 1University of Kansas — There has been increasing interest in the Recognition Potential. The effect was originally thought to reflect only orthographic-level processing, but more recent evidence has suggested that it can reflect semantic-level processing as well (Dien, Frishkoff, Cerbone, and Tucker, 2003; Martin-Loeches, Hinojasa, Casado, Munoz, Fernandez-Frias, 2004). However, with only two studies the effect could be due to confounds. The current study replicated this effect with entirely new stimuli using a 128channel high-density array. H71 CAN MUSICAL SOUNDS PRIME SEMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS? Julia Grieser Painter1, Petr Janata2, Stefan Koelsch1; 1Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, 2Center for Mind and Brain, University of California, Davis — The purpose of our study was to investigate whether musical sounds (timbres) presented outside of a musical context can prime semantic associations. In Experiment 1 subjects had to perform a lexical decision task in which the prime stimulus could be a sound (selected from a wide array of natural and unnatural musical timbres) or a word. The target was either a word or non-word. Relatedness between sounds and words was determined via a rating in which subjects had to compare sounds and words. As expected, the sound-word condition revealed a significant effect of relatedness in reaction times. A second experiment was conducted using EEG in which subjects were presented with related and unrelated word-word, sound-word, word-sound and sound-sound pairs and had to perform a memory task. There was a weak effect of target relatedness on ERP amplitude in the time window from 400 ms to 600 ms after stimulus onset, mainly at frontal electrodes. The results suggest that semantic associations are primed not only by musical pieces with a certain structure (rhythm, melody etc.), but also by discrete musical sounds. However, the exact nature of this priming effect, i.e. the way in which sounds elicit meaningful associations and under which circumstances remains to be investigated more closely. H72 A COMMON INDEPENDENT COMPONENT OF THE P3B, N400, AND P600 ERP COMPONENTS David Groppe1, Scott Makeig2, Marta Kutas1; 1University of California, San Diego, 2Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, University of California, San Diego — Two of the most reliable and most studied neural correlates of language comprehension are the N400 and P600 ERP components, canonically elicited by semantically and grammatically anomalous words (respectively). While these phenomena have provided valuable information about the nature and time course of language comprehension, their utility has been limited by the fact that they are most likely composed of multiple, functionally and anatomically distinct subcomponents whose contributions to the N400 and P600 overlap in time and space. For example, interpretation of the N400 and P600 is complicated by their uncertain relationship to the P300 ERP component elicited by a wide range of deviant stimuli. In order to identify a possible P300-like subcomponent common to the N400 and P600, all three ERP components were elicited from the same experimental participants in the same recording session using their canonical paradigms. Independent component analysis (ICA) was then applied separately to the N400/P600 data and P300 data to define subcomponents of these effects. ICA found  \\x0cPoster Session H  what appears to be a midline central subcomponent (MCe) that is common to all three ERP components (it accounts for around 50% of the variance of each component). This MCe subcomponent is characterized by a late positivity that is enhanced to rare/anomalous stimuli, habituates over the course of the experiment, and tends to peak later for stimuli that presumably take longer to evaluate. In light of these characteristics, we tentatively link the MCe subcomponent to the allocation of attentional resources. H73 N400 PRIMING STUDY OF CATEGORY EXEMPLAR TYPICALITY Jill Grose-Fifer1, Diana Deacon2; 1John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, 2City College, CUNY — An initial N400 study demonstrated that non-associated, categorically related stimuli produced priming when presented to the right hemisphere (RH) but not to the left (LH). Furthermore, significant priming only occurred when the prime and target shared considerable semantic feature overlap (e.g., MOSQUITO-FLEA). This finding supports our hypothesis that concepts are represented in RH networks on the basis of their semantic features. However, the necessity of generating many stimulus pairs resulted in the use of low typicality exemplars from any given category. This may have limited the contribution of LH in the task since mediated priming could potentially occur through spreading activation from the prime to the target via the category label, provided that there were strong enough associative links between them. A second N400 study investigated the effects of exemplar typicality in categorical priming within the cerebral hemispheres. A divided field paradigm was used to present both prime and target to one visual field or the other, on a random basis. Prime-target pairs were either unrelated or categorically related with low semantic feature overlap (e.g., LION-PIG). Related primes and targets were chosen from the Battig and Montague category norms for their high response frequency (typicality). Our results showed that increasing prime and target typicality did not increase the incidence of priming in the left or right hemisphere. Thus, we surmise that typicality of category exemplar does not provide a strong enough associative link to elicit mediated LH priming and RH priming is based on semantic feature overlap. H74 NOUN AND VERB GENERATION IN A MINIMAL SENTENCE CONTEXT: TESTING THE SENSORY-MOTOR HYPOTHESIS OF SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS Patrick Khader1, Kerstin Jost1, Michelle Mertens1, Frank Rösler1; 1Experimental and Biological Psychology, Philipps-University Marburg — Are nouns represented in visually and verbs in motor-related brain areas, as predicted by the “sensory-motor hypothesis” of semantic representations? In an event-related fMRI study, seventeen participants generated nouns with strong visual associations and verbs with strong motor associations. In contrast to previous studies, the to-be-generated target words were highly constrained by a preceding minimal sentence context, (e.g., “carpenter cuts ?…wood” or “carpenter wood ?…cuts”). Consistent with the sensory-motor hypothesis, noun generation activated occipital-temporal areas more than verb generation, indicating stronger recruitment of visual representations. However, when compared to a non-semantic control task, in which a rhyme had to be generated, also verb generation elicited activation in occipital-temporal areas, indicating that semantic generation of both nouns and verbs triggered visual associations or visual imagery. Furthermore, stronger activation for verbs was not found, as expected, in the motor cortex, but in the left prefrontal cortex. This presumably reflects processing differences due to the grammatical status of the two word categories. Therefore, the results provide only partial support for the sensory-motor hypothesis of word representations.  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  H75 THE SOUND OF CONCEPTS: THE LINK BETWEEN AUDITORY AND CONCEPTUAL BRAIN SYSTEMS Markus Kiefer1, Eun-Jin Sim1, Baerbel Herrnberger1, Jo Grothe1, Klaus Hoenig1; 1University of Ulm, Germany — The organization of the conceptual system is a matter of a debate. Classical models assume that conceptual knowledge is represented in a unitary system in an amodal format distinct from the sensory and motor systems. More recent models, however, propose that concepts are embodied in the sense that interactions with objects form their conceptual memory traces in distributed modality-specific brain areas, which typically process sensory or action-related object information. In support of modality-specific models, previous neurophysiological studies showed that conceptual tasks activate brain areas involved in the processing of visual and action-related information. Here, we investigated the neural representation of acoustic conceptual features (to ring) using fMRI and ERPs. Participants performed a lexical decision task on visually presented object names that referred to objects with (“telephone”) or without acoustic conceptual associations (“book”) as well as on pseudowords as distracters. Words with acoustic conceptual associations elicited in comparison to words without acoustic associations stronger activity in the left middle and superior temporal gyrus (BA 21, 22). This area in auditory association cortex was also activated during an auditory localizer task when participants listened to natural sounds in comparison to acoustic noise. ERP analysis revealed differences between words with and without acoustic associations as early as 150 ms suggesting that these effects reflect rapid access to acoustic conceptual features rather than post-conceptual processing. In line with models of embodied conceptual representations, our results suggest that acoustic conceptual features are coded in a modality-specific fashion in the corresponding sensory cortex. H76 ERP CORRELATES OF VERB-ACTION AND SENTENCE-SCENE ROLE RELATIONS INCONGRUENCE IN A SENTENCE-PICTURE VERIFICATION TASK Pia Knoeferle1, Thomas P. Urbach2, Marta Kutas2; 1 Center for Research in Language, University of California San Diego, 2Cognitive Science, University of California San Diego — Previous behavioural and ERP studies have shown that scene events can rapidly inform sentence comprehension in real time. In contrast, little is known about the potential cost (e.g., when aspects of language and scene are incongruent) associated with their use, a key element in predicting their rapid use in online sentence comprehension. In two experiments, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded during sentence word by word reading of NP1-VERB-NP2 sentences after participants had inspected a scene that either matched or mismatched aspects (e.g., a verb or thematic relations) of the sentence. Participants\\' task was to verify whether or not the sentence matched the prior visual scene. Verification response latencies, as well as mean amplitude of ERPs were more negative from 300 to 500 ms after verb onset when the verb did not match versus matched the depicted action event. Reliable correlations between response latencies and mean N400 amplitude were consistent with an interpretation in terms of processing cost. Direct comparison of verb-action mismatches with scene-sentence role relations mismatches revealed earlier ERP effects of the role relations mismatch. Together our findings show a clear cost for integrating scene and language that varies with which aspects of scene and sentence are incongruent. Theories of comprehension that postulate rapid use of visual context must incorporate a cost function to more accurately predict the time course and importance of visual context for online language comprehension. H77 AN EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL STUDY OF COMPLEMENT COERCION Gina Kuperberg1,2, Neil Cohn1, Arim Choi1, Martin Paczynski1, Tali Ditman1, Phillip Holcomb1, Ray Jackendoff1; 1Tufts University, 2Massachusettes General Hospital — Traditional linguistic theories and processing models hold that the build-up of sentence meaning derives primarily from syntactic relationships that combine the meanings  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  251  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  of lexically-stored items. Syntactic composition, however, does not always dictate sentence meaning. For example, to comprehend “The author began the book”, the meaning of “book” must be semantically ‘coerced’ so that it is interpreted as an event, e.g. “writing the book”. Psycholinguistic studies using reading times, speed-accuracy tradeoff, eyemovements and MEG suggest that this type of coercion incurs an immediate online processing cost. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to further examine the neural nature of this cost. ERPs were recorded to critical nouns (CNs) that, depending on their preceding verbs, were noncoerced (“The author wrote the book…”), semantically (animacy) violated (“The author disgusted the book…”), or coerced (“The author began the book…”). The non-coerced and coerced sentences were matched in terms of their plausibility (using prior ratings) and lexicosemantic association between the CN and its preceding content words (using a Latent Semantic Analysis). Animacy violated, relative to noncoerced, nouns evoked an N400 effect and, consistent with previous observations on animacy violated verbs, also a P600 effect. The coerced (relative to the non-coerced) nouns evoked an N400 effect that was equal in magnitude to that evoked by the anomalous nouns. These findings support the theory that the neural cost of such complement coercion is semantically-driven. They also underscore the sensitivity of the N400 to multiple types of semantic representation and processes, including semantic composition. H78 ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL: HOMOGENEITY OF SEMANTIC ACCESS FOR ALL WRITTEN INPUTS Sarah Laszlo1, Kara D. Federmeier1; 1University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign — Models of single word reading based on neuropsychological data implicate two functionally and neurally separable processes in the recognition of written inputs, depending on whether those inputs adhere to common spelling-to-sound translation rules (i.e., are orthographically regular). Competing models, based on behavioral data, instead allow all written inputs to undergo functionally identical computations regardless of their spelling-to-sound regularity. In this study, we followed up on growing event-related potential (ERP) evidence supporting single-process models by determining whether familiar, but orthographically illegal acronyms (e.g., VCR) could elicit classic N400 congruity effects similar to those elicited by words, despite their irregular spelling-to-sound correspondences. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired while participants read sentence frames ending with expected or unexpected words, expected or unexpected acronyms, or meaningless (and, hence, unexpected) illegal strings of letters. Characteristic N400 effects of congruency (smaller amplitude responses to expected as compared with unexpected items) were observed in response to both words and familiar acronyms, supporting single-process models of visual word recognition. Interestingly, clear N400 potentials were also observed in response to meaningless illegal strings for what is, to our knowledge, the first time in the literature. That unfamiliar and illegal letter strings elicit electrophysiological responses linked to semantic access is interpreted as evidence that attempts at semantic access can be obligatory and not gated by stimulus properties such as orthographic regularity or familiarity. H79 EFFECTS OF IMAGEABILITY WITHOUT AWARENESS IN THE ATTENTIONAL BLINK: AN ERP STUDY James Loomis1, Tamara Swaab2; 1UCSD, 2UC Davis, Center for Mind and Brain — High imageable words (cigar) are easier to understand than low imageable words (belief). This imageability effect has been attributed to the possibility that high imageable words draw on both image and verbal codes, whereas low imageable words activate only verbal codes. However, it is not known whether image codes are accessed without awareness of the semantics of words. In two experiments we recorded Event-Related Potentials to words inside and outside of the attentional blink, a period during which participants cannot attend to a stimulus. There were two key manipulations: 1) the semantic relationship of the prime and target (related or  252  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  unrelated); and 2) the imageability of the words (high or low). The task of the participants was to detect whether a string of digits was odd or even and whether a probe word was related or not to the prime (experiment 1), or whether a probe word was high or low imageable (experiment 2). Whereas behavior was impaired in the attentional blink, ERP data show dissociable effects of priming and imageability in both experiments, both inside and outside of the attentional blink. These results are consistent with the idea that effects of imageabilility can be obtained even when participants are not aware of the target words. H80 THE ROLE OF THE TEMPORAL LOBES IN THE COMPREHENSION OF METAPHORIC AND NON-METAPHORIC TEXTS Nira Mashal1, Miriam Faust2, Mark Jung-beeman3; 1The University of Chicago, 2Bar-Ilan University, Israel, 3Northwestern University, Evanston — Much evidence from neuroimaging studies indicates that the processing of text is subserved by both left and right temporal lobes. Yet, few studies have compared brain activation of metaphoric and non-metaphoric texts, beyond simple word pairs. We used fMRI to examine brain activation patterns in the bilateral superior temporal gyri while 15 healthy participants read either four-line metaphoric texts or non-metaphoric texts. The metaphoric texts were rated as more difficult to understand than the matching non-metaphoric texts allowing us to test the hypothesis that right hemisphere involvement is associated with increased difficulty level. Surprisingly, metaphoric texts resulted in significantly lower activation than non-metaphoric texts in the left and right anterior superior temporal gyri. However, item analysis revealed that difficult metaphoric texts elicited stronger activation than easy metaphoric texts in right anterior superior temporal gyri. The results are interpreted as indicating that bilateral anterior superior temporal gyri contribute to the integration of text elements into a coherent message. H81 SARCASM COMPREHENSION: AN EVENT RELATED POTENTIALS INVESTIGATION Marguerite McQuire1, Stephanie Fisher1, Christopher Lovett1, Seana Coulson1; 1University of California, San Diego — Sarcasm is a form of figurative language where the non-literal meaning opposes its literal meaning. Sarcasm typically consists of a positive statement that expresses negative intent, as in exclaiming, “Perfect day for a picnic!” during a torrential rainstorm. To examine how the brain processes this non-literal form of language, we recorded eventrelated potentials (ERPs) of sixteen healthy, native English speakers as they listened to stories that ended with a visually presented phrase. The final word in each utterance determined the condition of each phrase as being sarcastic or literal and was balanced for valence. For example, a story describing an encounter with a hostile indigenous tribe would be completed with “All the people we met there were so KIND” (sarcastic criticism) or “All the people we met there were so WARLIKE” (literal criticism). Alternatively, the story described an encounter with friendly villagers which was completed with “All the people we met there were so KIND” (literal compliment) or “WARLIKE” (sarcastic compliment). Results from this study suggest a greater cognitive load for processing sarcasm, as shown by a late positive complex (LPC) for sarcasm relative to literal endings. The data also suggest an interaction between valence and sarcasm. Individual differences such as gender, working memory and self-reported use of sarcasm will be discussed as predictors of sarcasm comprehension. H82 INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN INFERENCE GENERATION Heather Mirous1, Mark Jung-Beeman1; 1Northwestern University — When people comprehending stories hear a premise state (John was wearing jeans) and later a changed state (John is wearing a tuxedo), they bridge this gap by inferring a causal connection (John changed). People draw such inferences when they are necessary to maintain story coherence, but the component processes and brain bases of these inferences are not well established. Prior work in cognitive neuroscience has shown differential  \\x0cPoster Session H  semantic activation in the right and left hemisphere during inference generation, with the right hemisphere showing more activation at an early or predictive time point in the text, and the left hemisphere showing more activation at a later or bridging time point. Individual differences in working memory, background knowledge, and motivation also can affect inference processing, though the mechanisms are not fully explicated. This study examines the influence of individual differences, namely trait anxiety, mood, and working memory capacity on inference processes in both hemispheres, by contrasting priming of inference-related target words presented to each visual hemifield. Current results show stronger inference-related priming in the RH early in the course of drawing inferences. Working memory as well as trait and state affect modulation of inference-related priming across time points in both hemispheres will also be discussed. H83 THE EFFECT OF RHYME ON SEMANTIC EXPECTANCY Fereshteh Modarresi1; 1University of Ottawa — This paper investigates the range of linguistic situations in which the N400 component is observed. Although the main characteristic of N400 is its high sensitivity to semantic processes (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980), there is evidence that it is also modulated by phonological variables. This paper examines the interaction between auditory rhyme and semantic information during sentence processing and their overall effect on ERP indices, notably the N400. The experiment uses both behavioural reaction times (RT) and Electrophysiological (ERP) measures. The participants listen to sentences in the Persian language that consist of both rhyme and semantic primes. Participants must judge the congruency of the target item. This will allow us to determine how the rhyme can affect “lexical expectancy” and “lexical activation” in memory. The experiment design is inspired by a Persian language game, in which the presence of a non-word prime (presented before the question) interferes with access to the semantically appropriate word (in the answer). The sentence stimuli were presented auditorily and consisted of questions and answers (targets) in a 2 by 2 design. The target item either rhymes or does not rhyme with the non-word prime preceding the question, and is semantically related or not related to the highly expected true responses. The highly expected correct answer has been used as the base line with which other sentences will be compared. Behavioural results suggest a speed-accuracy trade-off while preliminary ERP results suggest that the N400 is much affected by sentential phonological congruency. H84 UNDERSTANDING PHYSICAL EFFORT THROUGH LANGUAGE Claire Moody1, Veronika Chuang1, Silvia Gennari1; 1 University of York - United Kingdom — This study investigates how we understand actions as described by language. It presented participants with sentences describing actions that were more or less effortful or involved no physical effort, for example, “The delivery man is pushing the piano”, “The delivery man is pushing the chair”, “The delivery man has forgotten the piano”. It was hypothesized that sensory-motor brain regions encoding properties of actions such as supplementary motor cortex (middle frontal gyrus - MFG) would be sensitive to the effort manipulation. Moreover, because to understand the difference in implied effort the same verb (“push”) must be semantically integrated with different objects (chair vs. piano), areas responsible for such semantic integrations such as left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) may also be sensitive to the effort manipulation. It was found that MFG and LIFG showed activation consistent with a positive linear trend as a function of physical effort. The same trend was also found in the posterior middle temporal gyrus, an area often associated with verbs and actions. Results indicate that understanding actions through language requires interactions between sensory-motor regions and LIFG with all these areas being sensitive to the degree of semantic information (effort) implied by the sentence.

ClarkeDavidson1; 1University of Alberta — Neuroimaging studies and lesion evidence have implicated frontal lobe function during an array of phonological and semantic language processing tasks. Binder, Westbury, McKiernan, Possing, and Medler (2005) showed that in particular, abstract words were more reliant than concrete words on inferior frontal lobe regions that have been strongly implicated in phonological processing and verbal short-term memory. A well known measure of frontal lobe function is verbal fluency – how many words one can produce in a minute when given the first letter. If phonological and concreteness information are mediated through the frontal lobes, then we would expect to see a.) evidence of an interaction between phonological load and concreteness in aphasic subjects, especially in the auditory modality that stresses phonology, and b.) verbal fluency scores that correlate highly with measures of phonological load and abstract word processing. We tested these hypotheses by using data from the Alberta Language Function Assessment Battery (Westbury, 2006) for 38 mixed aphasics. We found an interaction effect between phonological neighborhood size and concreteness in auditory, but not visual, lexical decision. Correlations of verbal fluency with lexical decision scores were reliable and higher for words with many neighbors than words with few neighbors, but only in the auditory modality. Correlations of verbal fluency scores with synonym judgment scores were reliable and higher for abstract than concrete words in both the auditory and visual versions of the task. These results provide behavioral evidence of convergent processing of abstract words and phonological load in frontal regions.  Memory: Working memory H86 BRAIN ACTIVITY RELATED TO UPDATING OF VERBAL Hirokazu WORKING MEMORY: AN ERP STUDY Satoshi Abe1, Bokura1, Shuhei Yamaguchi1; 1Shimane University School of Medicine — The central executive function in working memory involves mental process, which performs ongoing revision of working memory stores. This memory updating is understood as a type of switching between the activity for maintaining the current string of a fixed number of items, and the activity for changing this list. Converging evidence indicates that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in this executive process. In this study we recorded ERPs during a running memory task, in which subjects dynamically revised memory store, to clarify the spatial-temporal pattern of brain activity for memory updating. Subjects were presented with lists of a varying length from four to eight words composed of two syllables. After each list, a recall of the four most recent list words was required. We compared ERPs elicited by first four words (control trials) and those by words after the fifth in the list (update trials). The difference wave between control and update trials showed potential shift over the frontal scalp site with left hemisphere dominance, beginning at the latency of about 200 ms. The shift increased after about 1000 ms, and lasted after that. Another potential shift started to show up over the temporal-parietal site at the latency of 800ms. The present study suggests that updating of verbal working memory is triggered by prefrontal cortex and involves the distributed network including prefrontal and posterior association cortices.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  253  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  H87 HUMAN RECREATIONAL (MDMA) USE AFFECTS FMRI BRAIN ACTIVATION DURING WORKING MEMORY. Jane Allendorfer1,2, Martine Lamy1,2, James Eliassen2,3; 1University of Cincinnati Neuroscience Graduate Program, 2University of Cincinnati Center for Imaging Research, 3 University of Cincinnati — Recreational ecstasy (MDMA) use is associated with memory impairments. Animal studies have shown MDMA to have neurotoxic effects on serotonergic neurons and to impair memory performance. Due to the variability of drug exposure, the functional consequences of human recreational ecstasy use remains unclear. To demonstrate the effects of ecstasy use, we studied 7 current ecstasy users and 7 non-ecstasy drug users as comparison subjects matched to the ecstasy users by age, education and cannabis use. Since neurotoxic effects of MDMA are thought to underlie memory impairments in ecstasy users, we hypothesized that ecstasy users will exhibit abnormal activation during a working memory task in brain regions that receive dense serotonergic innervation. During fMRI, participants performed an N-back task (0back, 1-back and 2-back) in which they pressed the button corresponding to the number either on the screen (0-back), one screen prior (1-back), or two screens prior (2-back). We found no differences in accuracy or reaction time between groups. However, during working memory conditions (1-back and 2-back), ecstasy users showed increased activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus and the anterior cingulate but decreased activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) compared to comparison subjects. The right IFG becomes more active during working memory, but this level of activation is diminished in ecstasy users. The increased activation observed in ecstasy users during working memory may indicate compensatory activation to deal with increasing task demands and may account for the lack of observed differences in behavioral performance between groups. H88 MEASURING AGE-BOUND CHANGES IN MENTAL CAPACITY: THE ROLE OF MISLEADING CUES Marie Arsalidou1, Juan PascualLeone1, Janice Johnson1; 1York University, Toronto — The n-back paradigm is commonly used in neuropsychological research on working memory (WM). This task is not well scaled in terms of complexity, however, limiting its usefulness in developmental research. We adapted the 1-back paradigm to create two versions of a task designed to measure mentalattentional (M-) capacity. M-capacity corresponds to the maximal number of schemes one can effortfully attend to simultaneously. This number grows with age in childhood and is a causal component of WM. The Color Matching Task (CMT) was designed to be suitable for use with fMRI. Mental demand is increased gradually by manipulating the number of stimulus features participants must consider in order to determine whether the current stimulus matches the previous one. The CMT-Balloon task contains segregated cues, whereas CMT-Clown contains integral cues making the latter more misleading. Behavioural data were collected from 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14 year olds and adults (N=149). We found significant model-predicted differences in performance between the CMT versions. Both versions correlated highly with a well established measure of M-capacity (i.e., Figural Intersection Task; FIT). Overall, CMT-Clown behaved better as a measure of M-capacity; it yielded the theory-predicted M-capacity scores for all age groups and these scores were very close to those predicted and obtained with the FIT. Results support the theoretical prediction that misleading tasks provide better measures of capacity. In future work we plan to implement the CMTClown in fMRI. We expect in this way to delineate brain areas responsible for age-appropriate performance as developmental stages are assessed cross-sectionally.  254  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  H89 THE LIMITS OF VISUAL MEMORY AND ITS ALLOCATION ACROSS EYE MOVEMENTS Paul Bays1,2, Masud Husain1,2; 1Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, UK, 2Institute of Neurology, University College London — Visual working memory is a limited resource. Previous attempts to characterise this limit have sought to identify a fixed number of items that can be held simultaneously in memory. Here we investigate the precision with which visual information from multiple items is maintained, both within a single fixation and across eye movements. Testing memory for item locations and orientations, we find no evidence for a fixed item limit, but rather a dynamic allocation of visual memory resources, whereby increasing numbers of items are encoded with decreasing precision. Memory for item locations is not disrupted by an intervening saccade, implying that the entire contents of visual memory are predictively updated to account for the change in gaze position. Although a saccade did not affect overall performance, the item that was the target of the eye movement was recalled with greater precision than non-target items, demonstrating preferential allocation of resources to the saccade target. Crucially, in a sequence of eye movements, this privileged memory was observed only for the most recent saccade target, and not for targets of previous saccades. Thus visual memory resources appear to be reallocated prior to each new eye movement, effectively wiping out information stored in earlier fixations. H90 THE IMPACT OF ATTENDING TO DISTRACTORS: A STUDY OF LOW-LEVEL VISUAL WORKING MEMORY Anne Berry1, Aaron Rutman1, Wesley Clapp1, Theodore Zanto1, Adam Gazzaley1; 1University of California, San Francisco — Top-down modulation is characterized by differential enhancement or suppression of neural activity in sensory cortical regions. One’s ability to attend to pertinent sensory information and ignore irrelevant stimuli is often correlated with this neural modulation. In a previous study, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded as subjects participated in a single face delayed-recognition task in which face distractors were introduced during the delay period. The degree to which the distractors were attended impacted their performance as reflected in the modulation of the P100 and N170 components for the distractors. The present study used the same paradigm, but utilized coherent motion stimuli to test whether early neural modulation exists for lower-level visual stimuli, and what impact distraction has on performance. In a delayed-recognition paradigm, subjects were asked to maintain their memory for motion direction over a delay period in which there either was an attended visual distractor (swirling dots), an unattended visual distractor, or no distractor. A passive viewing condition served as a baseline to measure relative enhancement and suppression. Working memory accuracy when the distractor was attended to correlated with measures of enhancement in N170 latency and amplitude for the distractor. Also, the impact of distraction on response time correlated with enhancement in N170 latency to distracting stimuli, such that subjects who showed the greatest enhancement for the attended distractors demonstrated the poorest working memory performance. This study suggests top-down modulation of early visual processing correlates with the impact distraction has on working memory performance for lower-level visual stimuli. H91 IMPROVED WORKING MEMORY WHEN INDIVIDUALS WITH ALZHEIMER’S USE A BROAD ATTENTIONAL FOCUS Giselle Braganza1, P.M. Greenwood2, J.A. Levy3, R. Parasuraman2; 1The Catholic University of America, 2George Mason University, 3University of Utah — Although there is increasing evidence of a processing overlap between visuospatial attention and working memory (WM), it is not known whether that overlap is affected in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Individuals with AD are impaired in WM, but also experience some reduction in their ability to change the scale of the attentional focus in visual search (Greenwood et al., 1997). This raises the question of whether WM in AD benefits from a narrower attentional focus as has been seen in healthy individuals.  \\x0cPoster Session H  Based on our observation that APOE-e4 homozygotes benefit from an expanded rather than a constricted attentional focus in a WM task (Greenwood et al., 2005), we hypothesized that AD individuals would show a similar pattern. Spatial precues to location varied in size in a spatial WM task in Young, healthy Older, and AD groups. To examine effects at different levels of processing, precue size also was varied in detection and discrimination tasks. In the WM task, with a 3-second delay between precued target and test, small cues provided the greatest benefit in Young and Old. AD individuals showed the opposite effect, with better memory performance following the largest precue (p<.05). These results indicate that the influence of the spatial scale of attention on WM takes a different form in AD. A constricted attentional focus improves memory in healthy Old but a broad attentional focus improves memory in AD. If confirmed, these results indicate that WM in AD patients might benefit from training to expand the attentional focus. H92 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WORKING MEMORY ABILITY AND ATTENTIONAL CONTROL IN NORMAL CONTROLS AND YOUNG ADULTS WITH ADHD Gregory C. Burgess1, Marie T. Banich1,2,3, Erik Willcutt1,4; 1University of Colorado, Boulder, 2University of Colorado, Health Sciences Center, 3Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, 4Institute for Behavioral Genetics, University of Colorado, Boulder — Working memory (WM) ability has been associated with higher levels of attentional control in neurologically normal individuals (e.g., Kane & Engle, 2003) and has been suggested to contribute to attention problems in attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Barkley 1997). This study investigated the relationship between WM and neural activity during the attentionally-demanding Stroop color-word task in adults with ADHD (N=23) and normal controls (N=23). WM ability was indexed using forward and backward digit and spatial span tasks. Neural activity was indexed using fMRI during performance of a hybrid blocked / event-related Stroop task. Task blocks were incongruent, congruent, or neutral, and contained an equal proportion of blockspecific trials (e.g. incongruent) and neutral trials that were constant across all blocks. Regarding behavior, greater WM ability in ADHD was associated with increased behavioral facilitation, an association not observed in controls. This finding suggests that greater WM ability in ADHD led to more word reading, which is counterproductive to task demands. With regard to neural activity, a greater increase in bilateral DLPFC for the contrast of incongruent vs. congruent blocks was associated with higher WM scores in the ADHD group but lower WM scores in the control group. Furthermore, during individual task blocks, the control group deactivated default mode regions (i.e., posterior cingulate) less as WM ability increased. These results suggest that greater WM ability in the control group is associated with increasing neural efficiency, but with ineffective activation of attentional control regions in the ADHD group. H93 INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY SUPPRESS ANTICIPATED IRRELEVANT INFORMATION IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS. Wesley Clapp1, Rachel Litke1, Nikhil Murthy1, Adam Gazzaley1; 1University of California San Francisco (UCSF) — Previously we showed that when relevant and irrelevant information were presented quickly and randomly to older adults, they have a deficit in suppressing irrelevant information. The present experiment tested the ability of older adults to suppress anticipated irrelevant information. EEG was recorded from 16 healthy older subjects (age: 60-82) as they participated in a single face delayedrecognition task, comprised of four conditions; No Distractor, Ignore-Distractor (ID), Attend-Distractor (AD), and Passive View. In the distractor conditions, the degree to which one must attend to distracting information (a face in the delay period) was manipulated. In the ID condition, subjects were cued to anticipate the irrelevant distractor, while in the AD condition they were directed to attend to the distractor (i.e. make a simple decision about it). Behaviorally, subjects’ working memory performance declined in the presence of distraction. Recently, we found that  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  young subjects participating in the same experiment exhibited a N170 latency earliest for relevant stimuli (attended distractors), followed by passive view, and latest for irrelevant stimuli (ignored distractors). In older subjects, the N170 peaks earliest for attended stimuli, but responses to irrelevant stimuli peak at a similar latency as passively viewed stimuli, suggesting a selective inability to suppress irrelevant information even when the distractor could be anticipated. Supportive behavioral evidence of an inability to suppress distractors was obtained. Similar to younger subjects, this neural measure of suppression correlated with working memory accuracy, revealing that older subjects that exhibit N170 latency suppression of irrelevant information perform better at the task. H94 THE MAINTENANCE OF SPATIAL WORKING MEMORY, COVERT ATTENTION, AND MOTOR INTENTION IN THE HUMAN FRONTAL EYE FIELD Clayton Curtis1,2, Akiko Ikkai1, Riju Srimal2; 1New York University, 2New York University, Center for Neural Science — Frontal eye field (FEF) neurons are traditionally thought to transform visual signals into oculomotor commands. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the FEF is critically involved in higher-level visuomotor cognition. FEF activity has been reported during a variety of working memory, attention, and saccade preparation experiments. Here, we present fMRI data from three scan sessions of the same humans performing psychophysically demanding spatial working memory, covert attention, and motor attention tasks. These tasks were as similar as possible in terms of difficulty and design (e.g., stimulus eccentricity, perceptual and response modality, and timing). When subjects either a) maintained a location in working memory, b) covertly attended to a cued location, or c) prepared a saccade to a visually-cued location, FEF activity persisted throughout the entire long and variable delay periods. These signals persisted regardless of whether the task required memory, attention, or intention and they persisted regardless of whether a saccade was ever made. These data argue that the FEF do not simply code for the metrics of saccades, but may more generally represent the most salient locations in the visual field. Moreover, the FEF may utilize a common mechanism to support memory, attention, and intention. An important implication of this model is that functional role of the FEF generalizes to support each of these diverse processes not through a different mechanism but through its different interactions with other brain areas. H95 RELATIONAL ‘MATCH’ AND ‘MISMATCH’ SIGNALS IN THE HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS ARE DIFFERENTIALLY MODULATED BY ACTIVE MAINTENANCE AND PERCEPTUAL NOVELTY. Katherine D Duncan1, Lila Davachi1,2; 1New York University, 2Center for Neural Science, New York University — Determining whether an incoming event ‘matches’ or ‘mismatches’ a stored representation is proposed to lie at the core of the hippocampus\\' ability to switch between memory retrieval and encoding. Previous work has shown that ‘match’ enhancement for item information found in the perirhinal cortex depends on matches to actively maintained information. On the other hand, the corresponding ‘mismatch’ signals occurred irrespective of active maintenance (Miller, 1995). To investigate whether the theoretically important relational ‘match’ and ‘mismatch’ signals in the hippocampus are modulated by active maintenance, we fully crossed whether a probe stimulus ‘matches’ or relationally ‘mismatches’ a perceived or actively maintained image. Subjects performed two working memory tasks where they either responded ‘yes’ to probes that were identical to the previous sample scene, or performed a relational manipulated the scene and responded ‘yes’ only to a probe that is identical to this perceptually novel image. Using conventional fMRI (3x3x3 voxel size) we found evidence for relational ‘match enhancement’ within the hippocampus that was selective for matches between the probe and the actively maintained stimulus, but not influenced by perceptual novelty. We also found evidence for a complementary ‘mismatch enhancement’ signal in the MTL that was selective  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  255  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  for mismatches between the probe and what was seen before, but was not modulated by active maintenance. We will also present preliminary findings using high-resolution imaging from a similar paradigm to investigate how these memory signals map onto the subfields of the hippocampus. H96 HORMONAL AND GENETIC INFLUENCES ON PREFRONTAL CORTICAL FUNCTION. Jacobs Emily1, Cools Roshan2, D\\'Esposito Mark1; 1Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, UC Berkeley, 2Cambridge University — Dopamine transmission within the prefrontal cortex is critical for tasks dependent on working memory. The PFC is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in DA—both insufficient and excessive dopaminergic activity impairs PFC function. Taking into account an individual’s basal level of PFC DA is essential for predicting DA’s effect on cognitive processes. Individual differences in PFC DA stem in part from genetic polymorphisms that alter the efficiency of DA’s metabolic pathway. A polymorphism within the COMT gene produces an enzyme with four times greater activity. Individuals with the less active enzyme (met/met) have increased PFC DA relative to individuals with the more active enzyme (val/val). Estrogen also impacts the DA system by amplifying DA transmission. Thus, performance on tasks that depend on precise levels of PFC DA may vary throughout the cycle as estrogen levels rise and fall. Importantly, these effects may not be measurable unless individual variation in baseline DA levels is accounted for. This study investigates the effects of estrogen on the performance of DA-dependent tasks as a function of COMT genotype. Female subjects were pre-selected for COMT genotype and tested on two occasions, when estrogen levels are at their peak and trough. Subjects completed two WM tasks during an fMRI scan. For both genotypic groups, estrogen had a negative affect on performance when the task had no demand on WM. However when WM demands were high estrogen had a beneficial effect specifically for met/ met subjects. Preliminary analyses suggest hormone by genotype interactions at the behavioural and neurobiological level. H97 MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES OF SINGLE-SUBJECT VS. GROUP FMRI DATA FROM A VERBAL WORKING MEMORY TASK Eva Feredoes1,2, Todd S. Woodward2,3, Bradley R. Postle1; 1University of WisconsinMadison, 2University of British Columbia, 3Riverview Hospital — Univariate analyses of single subject (SS) data sets indicate considerable intersubject anatomical variability of brain regions involved in verbal working memory storage (Feredoes & Postle, 2007). These analyses also implicate multiple brain regions in storage, although they do not permit us to infer which of these regions act in concert as part of a functional network. Additionally, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) indicates that, among these regions, those located in left posterior perisylvian cortex and sensorimotor cortex make necessary contributions to storage, whereas a left PFC region identified via spatially normalized group-averaged (SNGA) analysis of the same data does not (Feredoes et al., 2007). In the present study we investigated functional connectivity in these data sets with a method based on constrained principal components analysis (cPCA), which could be applied specifically to the delay period from these delayed letter-recognition data. We tested three predictions. First, SS data sets analyzed with cPCA would reveal that many of the anatomically distinct brain regions identified with SS analyses would be functionally connected in a network supporting verbal short term storage. Second, in each subject, the region we targeted with rTMS in our previous study would comprise a node of this network. Third, cPCA of the SNGA data from this sample would not identify any regions in PFC as nodes in a verbal storage network. Preliminary results indicate that within individuals, there are multiple, separate brain regions located primarily in posterior regions, some of which include regions identified by our previous univariate SS analyses.  256  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  H98 ESTROGEN-MODULATED PERFORMANCE ON SEXADVANTAGED COGNITIVE TASKS Lena Ficco1, Matthew C. Davidson1; 1University of Massachusetts, Amherst — Differences in spatial and language abilities have been observed across the estrus cycle in healthy young females (Broverman et. al, 1981; Hampson, 1990). Estrogen (i.e., 17 &#946;-estradiol) is hypothesized to be the primary gonadal hormone involved in these differences; however, few studies have quantitatively measured 17 &#946;-estradiol levels in females at time of testing. We hypothesized that high levels of 17 &#946;-estradiol would enhance performance on articulatory tasks (e.g., counting, list reading, and color naming) and would impair performance on a visuo-spatial working memory task. To test these hypotheses, performance on these tasks was compared at two times, which coordinated with the menses (i.e., low 17 &#946;-estradiol, low progesterone) and late follicular (i.e., high 17 &#946;-estradiol and low progesterone) phases of the estrus cycle. Participants included naturally cycling (e.g., those not using synthetic hormone regulation or replacement) healthy young females. Saliva samples were collected at time of testing and processed via high sensitivity 17 &#946;estradiol and progesterone enzyme immunoassays. Preliminary results provide support for the first hypothesis, improved articulation, and suggest that fluctuations in 17 &#946;-estradiol underlie the variations in cognitive abilities observed across the estrus cycle. H99 EFFECTS OF WORKING MEMORY LOAD ON THE BOLD AND ERP RESPONSE IN YOUNGER AND OLDER ADULTS. Brian Gordon1,2, Nils Schneider1,2, Eunsam Shin1,2, Carrie Brumback1,2, Yukie Lee2, Ed Maclin2, Gabriele Gratton1,2, Monica Fabiani1,2; 1University of Illinois, 2Beckman Institute — Increasing age is accompanied by a decline in working memory (WM) performance. This age-related change is exacerbated at higher memory loads, and may originate from impairments in supraspan memory processing, necessary with increasing task demands. To examine differential WM performance, we recorded behavioral, BOLD, and electrophysiological data on 15 young and 30 old adults during a Sternberg memory task, with memory set sizes of 2-6items. As expected, older adults were less accurate and slower than younger adults, especially at the higher set sizes. Within the fMRI data, linear trend analyses were performed separately for set sizes 2-4 and 4-6. An analysis of the percent signal changes by load revealed a linear increase in the BOLD response in visual cortex (B17/18) and superior parietal cortex (B7) for young adults with increasing memory set sizes, with the greatest effects occurring in the 4-6 comparison. The old adults showed linear effects for set sizes 2-4, but no further increases at set sizes 4-6. These differences suggest altered WM processing in older adults. ERP data revealed a linear increase for the old during the presentation of the memory set, up to set size 6. The ERP slopes for set sizes 4-6 did not differ between young and old adults. These results suggest that, although neuronal activation (as represented by the ERPs) linearly increased in the old adults up to set size 6, the blood flow may already have reached ceiling at lower set sizes, indicating potential changes in neurovascular coupling. H100 SHORT-TERM MEMORY FOR SIGN LANGUAGE: ANALYSIS OF SERIAL AND FREE RECALL ERRORS IN DEAF AND HEARING PARTICIPANTS Marta Gozzi1, Carlo Geraci1, Carlo Cecchetto1, Costanza Papagno1; 1University of Milano, Bicocca — Phonological similarity and length effects detected in American Sign Language (ASL) short term memory (STM) tasks suggest that signs are retained in a system analogous to verbal STM. However, sign span is lower than word span with both ASL/English material and Italian Sign Language (LIS)/Italian material, even when controlling for articulation rate. Our studies investigated two factors potentially causing this discrepancy: (a) difficulty in maintaining sequential information with signs; (b) signs’ weight. In Study 1, we tested serial recall in 12 deaf and 12 matched hearing participants with 20 sequences that were one item longer than their span, using LIS  \\x0cPoster Session H  signs for deaf participants and visually and auditorily presented Italian words for hearing participants. All were able to correctly recall at least one sequence, confirming that the task was feasible. There were no significant differences between groups in the proportion of item or order errors. Deaf people made significantly more item than order errors, ruling out the possibility that lower span for signs is due to hypothesis (a). In Study 2, 16 deaf and 16 hearing participants were presented with 8item sequences for free recall. In addition to the standard serial position curve, we calculated the recency index (Postman and Phillips, 1965). Deaf participants showed a recency effect, but their recency index score was lower than that of hearing people. Since recency represents the output of the phonological store without the contribution of rehearsal, this suggests that signs are “heavy” and need more “space” to be stored, supporting hypothesis (b). H101 USING MORSE CODE TO UNDERSTAND VERBAL WORKING MEMORY REPRESENTATIONS Sara Guediche1,2, Maryam Khatami1, Jody Manners1, Julie Fiez1,2; 1University of Pittsburgh, 2Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh — In this study, we use Morse code to probe the nature of the representations that are maintained during verbal working memory. In participants who are fluent in Morse, we compared verbal working memory performance on a serial recall task using acoustically presented letters in speech and Morse code. Previous work has suggested that sentence comprehension ability is linked to verbal working memory performance. Therefore, we also assessed participants’ ability to listen to full sentences in Morse code and then copy the sentences. Participants who performed well on this task had equivalent verbal working memory performance for speech and Morse across the entire serial position curve whereas participants who were unable to maintain Morse sentences in memory performed better with speech. Preserved recall for final list items is especially noteworthy since some theories of verbal working memory have posited that a speech-specific acoustic store, the echoic store, contributes to recall of the final item. These results have two implications: 1) strong recency effects can be observed with stimuli that don’t have the spectro-temporal properties of speech, and 2) they provide further evidence for links between working memory and sentence comprehension. Future experiments will examine suffix effects on recency to permit further characterization of echoic representations in working memory. H102 DELAY-PERIOD NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS ARE MODULATED BY 10 HZ RTMS: A SIMULTANEOUS RTMS/EEG STUDY Massihullah Hamidi1, Heleen Slagter1, Giulio Tononi1, Bradley Postle1; 1 University of Wisconsin, Madison — Several recent studies have demonstrated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to behavioral facilitation during tasks requiring spatial working memory. Specifically, we have previously shown that 10 Hz delay-period rTMS of the parietal, but not prefrontal, cortex produces improvements in working memory performance. To determine the possible mechanism behind this facilitation, we repeated this study with simultaneous rTMS and electroencephalography (EEG). Healthy, young adult subjects performed two types of working memory tasks: one requiring memory of shapes, another requiring memory of locations. In half the trials, 10 Hz rTMS (110% of motor threshold) was applied during the delay-period to the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and, as a control, the somatosensory cortex of the post-central gyrus (PCG). We replicated the behavioral effect that rTMS to the SPL results in facilitation of memory of locations, but we found no change with memory of shapes. Preliminary EEG results revealed that during location memory trials, rTMS to the SPL resulted in a large increase in alpha-band (8.5-13 Hz) power in the posterior electrodes during the delay-period, whereas with memory of shapes, this change was not evident. rTMS of the PCG did not significantly affect alpha-band power with either memory task. Oscillatory changes in other  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  frequency bands, as well as changes in cross-frequency coherence were also assessed. H103 COMMON OR DISTINCT NETWORKS FOR PERCEPTUAL AND REFLECTIVE SELECTION? EVIDENCE FROM VIEWING AND REFRESHING FACES AND SCENES Matthew Johnson1, Marcia 1 1 Johnson ; Yale University — People can selectively highlight information for preferential processing in one of two ways: either perceptually, via direction of covert or overt attention in the presence of the stimulus, or reflectively, by preferentially mentally reviewing certain information after the original stimulus has disappeared from the environment. In this fMRI experiment, we compared the neural correlates of perceptual and reflective selection. On each trial, a face and a scene were shown simultaneously. Participants were cued either before presentation to look only at one of the pictures (overtly) and ignore the other (Attend condition), after presentation to think back to, or visualize, only one of the pictures (Refresh condition), or after presentation to simply press a button and not think of either picture (Act condition). Both overlapping and distinct patterns of activation were observed for perceptual (i.e., Attend-related) and reflective (i.e., Refresh-related) selection in brain areas associated with working memory, attention, and cognitive control. In addition, both types of selection were associated with modulation of activity in face- or scene-specific perceptual areas, with both enhancement and suppression of activity occurring in these areas relative to the control Act condition. H104 HIPPOCAMPAL INVOLVEMENT IN BETWEEN-DOMAIN BUT NOT WITHIN-DOMAIN ASSOCIATIONS Roy P.C. Kessels1,2, Carinne Piekema3, Mark Rijpkema3, Guillén Fernández3; 1NICI, Radboud University Nijmegen, 2Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, 3F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Radboud University Nijmegen, — The medial temporal lobe, and specifically the hippocampus, is important for associative memory in general. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that the human hippocampus is more involved in binding item information to spatial locations than other forms of itemcontext binding. These findings may be explained by the distinction between within- and between-domain associations. Presumably, the hippocampus is activated more in between-domain associative memory than in within-domain associative memory, operating as a binding device that integrates information processed in distinct brain regions. In an fMRI study, we investigated this hypothesis directly. Nineteen participants performed a 3-pair delayed-match-to-sample task in the scanner (Siemens Sonata 3T; 37 axial slices, TR = 2.18 s, TE = 25 ms), where associations had to be made between items processed within the same neocortical region (within-domain associations; house/house and face/ face associations) and between items that are processed in different neocortical regions (between-domain associations; house/face associations). This setup allowed us to directly compare the neural correlates of withindomain and between-domain associations. We show significantly more activation in the parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally (right local maximum at [34 -32 -16], t(16)=4.59, p=0.011; left local maximum at [-26 -20 16], t(16)=3.78, p=0.028) and the right hippocampus (local maximum at [26 -16 -16], t(16)=4.13, p=0.019) when between-domain associations have to be made, compared to within-domain associations. These results support the notion that both the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus are involved in the binding of information processed in distinct neocortical regions, and not only during spatial binding. H105 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WORKING MEMORY AND FILTERING EFFICIENCY REVERSES WITH TASK DEMANDS: AN ERP AND BEHAVIORAL STUDY Maria Kharitonova1, Tim Curran1, Akira Miyake1, Yuko Munakata1; 1University of Colorado, Boulder — Greater working memory capacity leads to better filtering of irrelevant information (e.g. de Fockert et al., 2001; Vogel, McCollough & Machizawa, 2005), potentially by enabling more efficient allocation of memory resources.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  257  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  However, this finding comes from tasks with clear demands for filtering, where subjects were instructed to filter irrelevant information and filtering was reliably advantageous for performance. In situations where it might ultimately help performance to represent currently irrelevant information, greater working memory capacity might support less filtering. To test this possibility, we assessed working memory capacity and filtering in tasks with differing filtering demands. In the high-filteringdemand task, participants made same/different judgments for visual arrays that contained 2 task-relevant and 2 irrelevant objects (as in Vogel et al., 2005). Filtering the irrelevant objects was advantageous for reducing memory demands. The low-filtering-demand task consisted of a taskswitching paradigm, in which the features that were irrelevant on one trial became relevant on the subsequent trial. Filtering the currently irrelevant information could thus hurt performance. In both cases, filtering efficiency was measured as the difference in performance across trials where irrelevant information was present (or was important for the subsequent trial) and when it was absent (or irrelevant for subsequent trials). As in previous work, under high filtering demands, working memory capacity (measured both with ERPs and behaviorally) and filtering efficiency (measured behaviorally) were positively correlated. However, this effect reversed under low filtering demands, demonstrating that greater working memory capacity can support less filtering under conditions where filtering is harmful for overall performance. H106 PROBING WORKING MEMORY REPRESENTATIONS WITH PATTERN CLASSIFICATION Jarrod Lewis-Peacock1, Bradley Postle1; 1University of Wisconsin, Madison — We describe a fMRI imaging study of humans engaged in long-term and working memory tasks. A patternclassification algorithm identified patterns of cortical activity associated with viewing and making judgments about three categories of pictures (famous people, famous locations, and common objects). Although perceptual processing was necessarily involved in this task, the study of these stimuli also relied on the processing of long-term semantic and episodic memories. The classifier was then used to track the reappearance of category-specific activity patterns during a delayed paired-associate recognition task. Results show that a given category’s activity pattern reappears and is maintained during the delay-period when a stimulus from that category was (1) presented at the beginning of the trial (a retrospective representation) or was (2) the probe stimulus anticipated to appear at the end of the trial (a prospective representation). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that working memory is supported by the temporary activation of long-term memory representations. Having established this theoretically important result, we next investigated the nature of these delay-period representations by comparing classification performance under several conditions: (1) whole-brain activity vs. a ‘feature selected’ subset of voxels, and (2) simple 2-layer network vs. a 3-layer network capable of identifying conjunctive representations of the input. Additionally, we explored the contribution of several local regions -- canonical cortical regions associated with category-specific representation (fusiform face area, parahippocampal place area, and lateral occipital cortex); and PFC -- by masking them and classifying activity from the remaining cortical regions. H107 VISUAL CHUNKING ALLOWS EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF MEMORY CAPACITY Andrew McCollough1, Edward Vogel1; 1University of Oregon — The ability to group information into \"chunks\" is a well know phenomenon in verbal working memory paradigms. However, the effects of chunking in the visual domain has not been well described. Here, we investigate the effects of visual chunking on working memory capacity, or K, utilizing gestalt principles to bias subjects to group individual items into larger, virtual objects. Subjects were presented with groups of three \"pacmen\", elements of Kaniza figures, that were either coherently organized to form illusory Kaniza triangles or randomly oriented, and asked to remember the orientation of the individual pacmen.  258  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  Subjcts performed a change detection task on a single pacman probe after a brief delay, indicating whether the pacman probe was in the same or different orientation as the sample. We then measured memory capacity based on the number of chunked objects versus individual elements in the display. Memory capacity was greater in the Kaniza triangle condition than the random condition. ERPs were also recorded during the experiment. In particular, the contralateral delay activity is an ERP component sensitive to the number of items held in memory during the delay activity of a visual working memory task. The effects of visual chunking on this component will be discussed. H108 AN INVESTIGATION OF WORKING MEMORY CORTICAL NETWORKS USING INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS Shashwath Meda1, Bradley Folley1,5, Vince Calhoun1,2,4, Michael Stevens1, Godfrey Pearlson1,2,3; 1Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center, Institute of Living at Hartford Hospital, Hartford, 2Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, 3Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 4The MIND Institute, Albuquerque, 5Vanderbilt University, Kennedy Center, Nashville — Background: Human working memory (WM) is a multi-regional task involving “temporary storage and manipulation” of information. We used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify different spatiotemporal networks involved in a Sternberg WM fMRI paradigm. Methods: Healthy controls (N=57) (Age- Mean+Stdev: 36.96+11.2 yrs; 31 male, performed a modified version of the Sternberg task, (Johnson et. al. 2006). Exclusion criteria included present/past DSM-IVAxis I disorder or psychotic first-degree relatives. Functional images were preprocessed using SPM2 and imported into the GIFT toolbox for ICA analysis. Resulting component networks were then correlated to the encoding and recognition phases of the experiment using multiple regression, to determine individual association (beta) values for each phase. Further, we performed paired sample t-tests on the beta values to identify componentrelated differences between conditions. Results: ICA revealed 15 taskrelated neural networks. Non-cognitive networks included: Motor, cerebellum, extrastriate visual, default mode. 5/15 networks were cognitiverelated task components: C1. Superior frontal-frontal eye fields (FEF) (p=3.3*10-7) C2. FEF- parts of DLPFC-anterior cingulate (ACC) (p = Not significant) C3. DLPFC-ACC-basal ganglia-STG-Broca (p=0.0003) C4. Superior and Inferior parietal (p=0.0003) C5. Anterior STG-FusiformInferior Temporal-Hippocampus/parahippocampus (p=0.0009) All components except C2 differed significantly between the two experimental conditions (Related p values indicated in brackets). Specifically, components C3 and C4 were more associated with the recognition phase and C1 and C5 with encoding. Conclusion: For the first time, we have demonstrated the usefulness and sensitivity of ICA in delineating different WM networks. Further, we determined specific associations between cognitive networks and WM task conditions. H109 BRAIN REGIONS MEDIATING WORKING MEMORY COMPONENT PROCESSES Michael Motes1,2, Bart Rypma1,2; 1 University of Texas at Dallas Center for BrainHealth, 2University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center — Exploration of the component processes that comprise delayed-response working-memory (WM) tasks is difficult due to the chronology of the component processes and the temporal resolution of FMRI. Assumptions about the shape of the BOLD response for each component process must be made, and sequential overlapping BOLD responses may not be able to be uniquely identified via traditional regression modeling. Resolving controversies regarding the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in encoding and maintaining information in WM (see Rypma, 2006) requires isolating component-related BOLD responses. “Partial-trial paradigms” (Ollinger et al, 2001) can obviate these problems. In the present study, we used the partial trial paradigm to examine brain regions mediating WM encoding, maintenance, and retrieval processes involved in a delayed-response WM task. Participants completed full trials that involved encoding one or six letters, maintaining the mem-  \\x0cPoster Session H  ory-set over a delay, and then searching WM to determine whether a probe was in the memory-set. Participants also completed encoding only, encoding and maintenance, and encoding and retrieval partial trials intermixed with the full trials. For the encoding only and encoding and maintenance trials a cue was given to terminate the trial and lead the participants to terminate the processes. Using this method, we were able to identify PFC regions that mediate WM encoding, maintenance, and retrieval component processes involved in remembering sub- and supracapacity memory sets. H110 TESTING COMPUTATIONAL PREDICTIONS OF THE ROLE OF BASAL GANGLIA DOPAMINE IN WORKING MEMORY: PARKINSONISM AND MEDICATION EFFECT Ahmed Moustafa1, Scott Sherman2, Michael Frank2; 1Rutgers University, 2University of Arizona — Computational models suggest that the basal ganglia, in particular striatal dopamine, play a critical role in working memory (WM) (O\\'Reilly & Frank, 2006; Moustafa & Maida, 2007). The models suggest that the basal ganglia trigger the updating of prefrontal cortical WM representations, and that phasic dopamine amplifies the updating of taskrelevant information relative to distractors. To test these ideas, we tested Parkinson\\'s patients both off and on their dopamine medications on a modified version of the AX-CPT task. In this task, knowing when and when not to update information are both important for successfully performing different aspects of the task. The task also includes distractor, attentional shifting, and learning phases that assess the role of striatal dopamine in WM. Preliminary results suggest that Parkinson\\'s patients are more impaired in comparison to matched controls and that striatal dopamine modulates working memory processes. We will discuss the results of this study pointing out the successes and failures of the neurocomputational models. H111 NEURAL MECHANISMS OF RETRIEVAL FROM SHORT-TERM MEMORY Derek Nee1, John Jonides1; 1University of Michigan — Theories of short-term memory (STM) are divided regarding architecture. Much of the controversy surrounds the capacity of STM, and whether information within STM shares an equal status, or whether there are distinct states of STM. One prominent proposal posits that within STM, a single item within the focus of attention is available for immediate cognitive operation that is distinct from other information in memory. At the present, neuroimaging studies investigating STM have not carefully examined this issue. Here, we used event-related fMRI to examine the neural correlates of STM retrieval while subjects performed a 3-item recognition paradigm. The rapid presentation of materials minimized rehearsal, permitting the ability to contrast retrieval of the presumed focus of attention versus retrieval of other items in STM. We found that relative to the focus of attention, retrieval of other items in STM elicited increased activation in regions of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 45), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (46/9), and left parahippocampal gyrus. By contrast, inferior temporal cortex demonstrated increased activation to recognition probes matching the focus of attention relative to other items in STM. Many of these regions also demonstrated significant correlations with behavioral measures of retrieval speed. These results support a distinction between the focus of attention and other information in STM. H112 LEARNING AND AWARENESS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: DISSOCIATING AGE-RELATED EFFECTS FROM COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE Geoffrey O\\'Shea1, Kimberly Sena Moore2, Dave Peterson3, Benjamin A. Clegg2, Gerald C. McIntosh2,4, Michael Thaut2; 1 SUNY-Oneonta, 2Colorado State University, 3University of California San Diego, 4Poudre Valley Hospital, Fort Collins, CO — Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients exhibit retrieval deficits from short-term memory (STM) while performing comparable to controls on implicit learning tasks involving motor skill acquisition and word priming. These studies are paradoxical in that MS patients can form long-term representations despite STM  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  retention difficulties. The present investigation assessed implicit learning in MS patients using the Hebb Digits (HD) task, which involves the incidental learning of a repeating nine-digit sequence. In the HD task, implicit learning is indexed through gradually improved memory for a repeating pattern of digits compared to a random series of digits. In contrast to other implicit learning tasks, such as the serial reaction task, performance in the HD task requires less motor responding and more reliance on working memory processes. The results of our investigation revealed that MS patients demonstrated HD learning. However, recall of both the repeating and random series was significantly greater in an agematched control group compared to the MS participants suggesting a global memory deficit associated with MS. The results of a post-experimental recognition test revealed HD learning in both groups to be reliant on explicit awareness of digit repetition. In summary, our results provide evidence for explicit, but not implicit learning in both MS patients and age-matched controls suggesting that global memory deficits in MS may limit working memory capacity, but not the ability to learn through repetition. Furthermore, these results suggest that the implicit learning capabilities of MS individuals are a function of the working memory component of the task. H113 MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE AND THE LEFT INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS JOINTLY SUPPORT INTERFERENCE RESOLUTION IN VERBAL WORKING MEMORY Ilke Öztekin1, Clayton Curtis1,2, Brian McElree1; 1New York University, 2Center for Neural Science, New York University — Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the role of left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions in resolving proactive interference (PI) in verbal working memory. Participants were presented 6-item study lists, and a recognition probe after a short distracter task. PI was manipulated with a release from PI paradigm: study lists were constructed from the same semantic category (e.g. animals), and the category was switched (e.g. fruits) after three consecutive trials. Interference from episodic familiarity was examined by comparing recent negative (RN) probes (lures studied in previous trial) to distant negative (DN) probes (lures not presented within a block). Both proactive and episodic interference effects resulted in enhanced activation in LIFG and MTL regions. However, the two effects interacted: In the absence of PI, RNs resulted in more activation than DNs in both LIFG and MTL; in the presence of PI, DNs engendered more activation than RNs in both regions, reversing the classical episodic familiarity effect. These findings suggest that LIFG supports the successful resolution of PI induced by semantic similarity, in addition to its wellestablished role in resolving misleading episodic familiarity. Results also indicate that LIFG and MTL jointly contribute to the resolution of interference in verbal working memory. Both regions may do so by mediating controlled retrieval processes that provide access to detailed episodic information (e.g. list-specific information or source memory). H114 DISENTANGLING THE WORKING MEMORY IMPAIRMENT IN ADHD. Joanne Park1, Sarah Seth2, David Coghill2, Sinead Rhodes1; 1University of Stirling, 2University of Dundee — Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterised by pervasive inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity and is prevalent in around 3-5% of children. Dysfunction of executive neuropsychological functioning e.g. working memory (WM), mediated by the prefrontal cortex, has been the central focus of recent ADHD research. Previous research conducted by our group has suggested that children with ADHD may be impaired in executive (manipulation) and non-executive (maintenance) aspects of working memory. The aim of the current study was to characterise WM functioning in ADHD using tasks specifically designed to tap both verbal and visuo-spatial executive and non-executive components of WM. Twelve drug-naïve children (all boys) with ADHD (mean age: 9.75, age range:7-13) and sex and age-matched controls participated in the study. All children were assessed on a vocabulary task (BPVS II), verbal and  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  259  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  spatial WM tasks and on a range of standardized neuropsychological WM tasks from the CANTAB battery. Children with ADHD were impaired on visuo-spatial but not verbal WM tasks. Impairment was particularly marked on the spatial executive WM task, requiring the ability to manipulate spatial locations in WM. Performance on standardized neuropsychological verbal and spatial WM tasks from the CANTAB battery corroborated these findings. The current data adds to evidence of WM impairment in ADHD suggesting that children with the disorder may have particular difficulties in executive aspects of visuo-spatial WM. H115 CONSTRUCTING AN INTEGRATED WORLD IN THE MIND: REFRESHING A SCENE IN THE PPA AND RSC Soojin Park1, Marvin M. Chun1, Marcia K. Johnson1; 1Yale University — Constructing a rich and coherent visual experience involves maintaining visual information that is not perceptually available in the current view. Recent studies suggest that briefly thinking about a stimulus can modulate activity in category specific visual areas. Here, we tested the nature of such perceptually refreshed representations in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) using fMRI. We asked whether a refreshed representation is specific to a restricted “view” of a scene, or more abstract and view-invariant. Participants saw a panoramic scene and were asked to refresh part of the scene after it disappeared. In half of the trials, the refresh cue appeared twice on the same side (e.g., left refresh-left refresh), and other trials, the refresh cue appeared on different sides (e.g., left refresh-right refresh). A control condition presented physical halves of the scene twice on same sides (e.g., left repeat-left repeat) or different sides (e.g., left repeat-right repeat). When scenes were physically repeated, both the PPA and RSC showed greater activation for the different side repetition than the same side repetition, suggesting view-specific representations. However, when participants refreshed scenes, the PPA showed view-specific activity just as in physical repeat conditions, whereas the RSC showed an equal amount of activation for different and same side conditions. This finding suggests that, in the RSC, refreshed representations were not restricted to a specific view of a scene, but extended into the whole scene and thus could provide a mechanism for integrating multiple views. H116 MEMORY DEMAND-INDUCED INCREASES IN ALPHA-BAND POWER CORRESPOND TO DYNAMIC NETWORK CHANGES Lisa Payne1, John Kounios1; 1Drexel University — Accumulating evidence supports that the phenomena of working memory (WM) is a result of synchronous oscillations between distant foci of activity. To elucidate WM network dynamics, scalp EEG was recorded while 10 participants performed a modified Sternberg task. Coherence was then measured between the electroencephalogram at different sites. In each trial, participants judged whether a probe consonant was one of the memory set of 2, 4, or 6 consonants. Analysis of the 2.8 s retention period confirmed previous findings of a parietal-occipital alpha frequency (8 – 12 Hz) peak that systematically increased with the number of items held in WM. Alpha frequency coherence increased between electrode PZ and left-lateralized parietal-temporal sites only between set sizes 2 and 4. There was no change in alpha coherence from 4 to 6 consonants. Interestingly, coherency between parietal electrode PZ and left temporal electrode T7 showed the most significant enhancement. Further analysis revealed that, although there was no change in theta band (4 – 7 Hz) power, theta coherence between T7 and frontal-central sites increased between set sizes 4 and 6 while simultaneously decreasing with parietal-occipital sites. These findings demonstrate that the WM network responds to initial increases in demand with enhancement of alpha band coherence, but higher demand is reflected by changes in theta band coherency. The changes in theta coherence confirm its expected, but previously undiscovered, involvement in increasing WM load. The increase in alpha coherence affirms its direct participation in the WM network, and combined with the theta results, indicates an inhibitory role.  260  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  H117 DISTINGUISHING VISUAL SEARCH AND WORKING MEMORY VIA CORTICAL AND HEART-RATE RESPONSES Pandelis Perakakis1, Jaime Vila1, Walter Machado-Pinheiro2, Pedro Guerra1, Aydamari Faria Jr2, Isabel DePaula Antunez2, Lourdes Anllo-Vento1,3; 1University of Granada, Spain, 2Federal Fluminense University, Niteroi, Brazil, 3University of California, San Diego — In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual search (VS) and visual-spatial working memory (WM) with cortical potentials (ERPs) and phasic heart-rate changes. Previous studies demonstrated that these cognitive operations were associated with distinct heart-rate response patterns. Thirty volunteers carried out VS or WM tasks in counterbalanced order. Each trial included two visual displays separated by 900 ms. In the WM task, subjects held in working memory the colors of 4 squares in the visual field signaled by a central arrow cue(1). During VS, subjects searched the cued visual field to detect a line crossing one of the squares. Following the second display, subjects reported either a color change in one of the squares (WM), or a change in line orientation (VS). Continuous EEG, horizontal EOG, and ECG were recorded throughout the experiment. RTs and percentage of correct responses were obtained following change and no-change trials. Percentage of correct responses did not differ across tasks. The amplitude of the N2pc component, a neural index of VS and filtering of irrelevant stimuli, was greater in the VS task, while the CDA, a contralateral parietal wave reflecting WM load, was similar under both conditions. Evoked heartrate changes were significant under VS but not WM conditions. These findings demonstrate that, though tightly coupled, VS and WM constitute distinct cognitive and neural operations. (1) Vogel & Machizawa, 2004, Nature, 428: 748-51 H118 THE INTERACTION BETWEEN STIMULUS FAMILIARITY AND RECENCY IN PROACTIVE INTERFERENCE RESOLUTION Ranjani Prabhakaran1,2, Sharon L. Thompson-Schill1,2; 1University of Pennsylvania, 2Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Pennslyvania — Proactive interference (PI) refers to interference from previously encountered items in memory. Resolution of PI involves rejecting a familiar but incorrect probe item and often results in increased reaction times and error rates in working memory (WM) tasks. Although previous studies have investigated the role of familiarity in terms of the short-term recency of the probe item, the interaction between a long-term memory manipulation in the form of stimulus familiarity and short-term recognition memory has not been investigated. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of stimulus familiarity on PI resolution in WM. In addition, this study aimed to tease apart the contributions made by fast assessments of familiarity versus slower recollective processes to recognition memory performance through the manipulation of response deadline (see Oztekin & McElree, 2006). A behavioral experiment was conducted in which subjects performed an item recognition task. Longterm stimulus familiarity was manipulated through the use of famous and nonfamous faces as stimuli. Response deadline was manipulated as a between-subjects variable, where half of subjects were presented with the probe item for 500 ms and the other half of subjects were presented with the probe item for 3000 ms. An interaction between recency and stimulus familiarity was found only in the shorter response deadline condition due to a larger interference effect in terms of both reaction time and false alarm rate for the famous compared to nonfamous faces. These data implicate a role for stimulus familiarity in the resolution of PI in WM. H119 NEURAL SYSTEMS INVOLVED IN WORKING MEMORY FOR SEMANTICALLY RELATED OBJECTS: AN FMRI STUDY Yakeel T. Quiroz1, Karin Schon1, Chantal Stern1,2; 1Center for Memory and Brain, and Center for Excellence in Learning, Education, Science, and Technology, Boston University, Boston, 2Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown — The role of cortical structures, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in working  \\x0cPoster Session H  memory (WM) is well known. Recent reports have also indicated an important role for the basal ganglia (BG) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions in WM. In the present study, we investigated the role of the BG, MTL, and DLPFC, in working memory for semantically related objects vs. semantically unrelated objects. The stimuli consisted of 210 pictures of everyday objects. Objects came from 12 semantic categories, and subjects were pre-trained on the stimuli the day before scanning. Sixteen young, healthy, subjects performed a Sternberg task while in a 3T Trio scanner. There were two task conditions. The Semantic Category condition (SC) included only items from the same category, and the Random Category condition (RC) included only semantically unrelated items. Each trial consisted of three sequentially presented events: encoding of 6 consecutively presented pictures (SC or RC), followed by a brief delay (maintenance), and then probe (retrieval). During retrieval, subjects indicated via button-press whether the probe picture matched one of the pictures seen during encoding. Results contrasted SC and RC trials. SPM analyses revealed significant bilateral BG and right MTL activations during encoding, bilateral BG and left DLPFC activations during maintenance, and frontal pole activation during retrieval. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that have reported BG activity during non-spatial WM tasks and extend previous findings by suggesting a role for this system in the encoding and maintenance of semantically related objects.

H120 DYNAMICS OF BRAIN OSCILLATORY NETWORKS INVOLVED IN WORKING MEMORY FROM MEG SIGNALS Sreenivasan Rajamoni Nadar1, Fred Carver1, Tom Holroyd1, Richard Coppola1; 1MEG Core Facility, National Institute of Mental Health, NIH, Bethesda — We characterized the functional organization of large-scale oscillatory networks involved in prefrontal, parietal, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other areas involved in working memory task. Twelve subjects performed nback working memory task, while MEG recordings was sampled at 600Hz with a 275-sensor radial gradiometer system. The MEG sensor data were mapped onto the MRI brain volume using Synthetic Aperture Magnetometry (SAM), an adaptive beamformer technique, to look at the variance between active states (1-back, 2 back) vs. control (0-back) and identified statistically significant areas. Then we extracted the single-trial time series for the brain regions that we obtained from SAM images and computed coherence, Granger causality spectra using Bivariate Autoregressive models for all pairwise combination of the source areas. The coherence and directed Granger matrix in theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands were analyzed for graph theoretic measures including clustering index and mean path length. These matrices were further analyzed to identify the critical network nodes for each frequency, time window and working memory conditions. Differences between memory loads (2back vs. 0 back, 1 back vs. 0 back) were found to be more robust in the beta frequency band centered around the response time window. A distributed set of interconnected network nodes were observed in prefrontal and parietal regions. Many nodes in these regions exert a variety of top-down and bottom-up causal influences in different frequency and time windows. Working memory was seen to engage a distributed network of prefrontal, parietal and ACC regions. H121 AGE-MEDIATED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN REGIONAL BRAIN ACTIVITY AND REACTION TIME COMMON TO WORKING MEMORY ENCODING, REHEARSAL, AND RECOGNITION Brian Rakitin1, Joseph Flynn1, Christian Habeck1, Jason Steffener1, Yunglin Gazes1, Yaakov Stern1; 1Division of Cognitive Neuroscience, Taub Institute, Columbia University — How do age and cognitive demands affect the brain regions that determine working memory performance? Healthy young (n = 40; mean age = 25.1 years) and elderly (n = 18; mean age = 74.4 years) subjects performed a delayed item recognition task for visually presented letters with three set sizes (1, 3, or 6 letters) while being scanned with BOLD fMRI. Voxel-wise analysss within encoding (3 s), retention (7s), and  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  retrieval (3 s) task phases examined the age-mediated differences in slope between change in BOLD signal and change in reaction time (RT), both with respect to set size. Conjunction analysis identified voxels where the difference-of-slopes test was significant during all three tasks phases. This analysis identified a large set of brain regions including the insula, DLPFC, and SMA, where higher set size-related BOLD signal predicted higher set sized-related RT changes in the aging, but not the young participants. These results suggest the presence in all three phases of either an inefficient representational scheme, or a counter-productive operation -beyond the standard encoding, rehearsal and recognition processes - in the aging participants only. In addition, a conjunction analysis of the mean set size-related BOLD signal change without the RT covariate indicated significant results one-tenth the extent of the difference-of-slopes analysis. These results suggest that the difference-of-slopes results are not an artifact of the high correlation between the GLM predictors associated with the time-locked task phases. H122 EVIDENCE FOR VISUO-SPATIAL AND VERBAL WORKING MEMORY IMPAIRMENT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH WILLIAMS SYNDROME. Sinead Rhodes1, Emma Fraser1, Deborah Riby1; 1University of Stirling, Stirling — Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic neuro-developmental disorder caused by the microdeletion of numerous genes at site 7q11.23. Characterised by a distinct cognitive profile of peaks and valleys, it is widely accepted that more severe impairments reside within the visuo-spatial domain than the verbal domain. Accumulating evidence suggests that individuals with WS show impairments in visuo-spatial working memory (WM). The current aim was to characterise WM functioning in WS using tasks that tap both visuo-spatial and verbal components. A secondary aim was to compare functioning on tasks with and without a central executive requirement. Twelve individuals with WS (ranging: 12-26; mean age:21) and 12 chronologically age-matched controls participated in the study. All participants were assessed on verbal (BPVS II) and non-verbal (Raven’s Progressive Matrices) ability tasks and verbal and spatial WM tasks. Individuals with WS were impaired on both executive and non-executive memory tasks. Surprisingly, individuals with WS showed similar levels of impairment on verbal and spatial WM tasks in comparison to matched controls. Verbal working memory abilities have not previously been assessed in WS. Our finding of impairment on executive and non-executive verbal working memory tasks adds to growing evidence suggesting that individuals with WS show deficits across a range of verbal tasks. Although early research suggested ‘intact’ or even ‘superior’ verbal skills in the profile of cognitive abilities associated with WS, the current evidence suggests working memory deficits within the verbal and visuo-spatial domain. H123 THE TOP-DOWN INFLUENCE OF MEMORY REPRESENTATIONS ON FACE PROCESSING Kartik K. Sreenivasan1, Deepak Sambhara1, Zev B. Rosen1, Amishi P. Jha1; 1University of Pennsylvania, Center for Cognitive Neuroscience — The present study investigated the top-down influence of actively maintaining a face in memory on the perceptual processing of faces. Previous reports have demonstrated enhanced neural activity in perceptual brain regions to memory probes that matched items being actively maintained in memory (e.g. Druzgal & D’Esposito, 2001). Yet, the neural mechanisms by which match enhancement occurs are not well understood. Here we investigated the hypothesis that match enhancement results from biased competition in favor of memory-relevant perceptual information. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the perceptual similarity between the probe item and the concurrently held memory representation and observed the influence of the memory representation on the neural response to probes. Participants (n = 15) viewed a series of faces, and responded to the presentation of a pre-learned target face during event-related potential (ERP) recording. Non-target probe faces varied in their similarity to the target face. The impact of memory representations on perceptual processing was assessed by the amplitude  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  261  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  of the occipito-temporal N250 ERP component, a neural correlate of the perceptual recognition of individual faces (Schweinberger et al., 1995). N250 elicited by probe face presentation was strongly modulated by the degree of similarity between the probe face and the target face; N250 amplitude was maximal to the target face and decreased as probe faces decreased in similarity to the target face. These results suggest that perceptual features comprising memory items may bias activity in perceptual regions, and that this competition may give rise to the phenomenon of match enhancement. H124 PERSISTENT ACTIVITY IN THE HUMAN FRONTAL EYE FIELD WHEN MAINTAINING SPACE THAT IS ‘OFF THE MAP’ KyeongJin Tark1, Clayton Curtis1,2; 1New York University, 2New York University, Center for Neural Science — During the maintenance of visuospatial information in working memory, neural activity in the frontal eye field (FEF) persists. Such signals are spatially selective, where activity is greatest in neurons whose response fields match the retinal location of the visual cue. Here, we used fMRI to test if human FEF activity persists when maintaining auditory space, and further test if the activity is selective for retinal space. We recorded binaural sounds emitted from 36 positions around the subject from microphones placed within each subject’s ear canals. Subjects could localize the replay of these sounds because the recordings preserved the interaural time and level differences. Then, we scanned subjects while they performed an audiospatial working memory task. They maintained the location of a sample sound (S1) over a long delay period and then indicated if it matched the location of a test sound (S2). Half of the sounds were emitted from locations that if visible would fall on the retina and half were from behind the subject. Independent staircases equated the difficulty for front and back cued trials by adjusting the distance of the S1/S2 discrimination. Putative FEF activity persisted when maintaining auditory-cued space, even when locations were behind the subject. We found this activity was greater in the hemisphere contralateral to the side of the cue when representing retinal space as well as extra-retinal space. Therefore, human FEF activity represents a map of space that includes locations in which it is impossible to make a saccade. H125 COMPUTERIZED TRAINING OF WORKING MEMORY - A METHOD FOR COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS Helena Westerberg1, David Söderman1, Yvonne Brehmer1, Nicolas Dhondt1, Håkan Fischer1, Stuart MacDonald1, Lars Bäckman1; 1Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm — Goal: To examine the effects of computerized training of Working Memory (WM) in normal adults (N100). Background: WM is essential for cognitive functioning. Age-related decline is typically observed in WM tasks but cognitive enhancement by training of WM has not been investigated earlier. Methods: 45 participants in ages 60-70 were randomized to a treatment or a comparison condition. To compare age differences in baseline performance and in training effects, a younger group, 20-30 years (N55) were included and randomized cross conditions. The treatment consisted of intense and adaptive computerized training (Cogmed QM) on WM tasks for five weeks. The comparison condition involved training using the same software, but the difficulty level remained constant. A cognitive test battery including non-trained tasks assessing WM, attentional functions, perceptual robustness, episodic memory, and reasoning were administered before and after the training period. The Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) was used to measure memory and attention in daily living. Results: In both age groups there was a significant difference between pre- and post training assessment in the training group, compared to the comparison group on the non-trained tests for WM, attention and perceptual robustness (reaction time). There were also a significantly lower number of cognitive symptoms reported. At followup three months after the intervention, most training effects were still significant between conditions. Conclusions: WM training can improve cognitive performance in healthy adults, -on neuropsychological tests and in  262  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  cognitive functioning in daily life. At follow-up three months after the training period most training effects remained. H126 FACE PROCESSING STRENGTH IN WILLIAMS SYNDROME EXTENDS TO MEMORY FOR FACES Anna Yam1, Yvonne M. Searcy1, Kiley J. Hill1, Mark Grichanik1, Ursula Bellugi1; 1The Salk Institute for Biological Studies — Williams syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a hemizygous microdeletion on chromosome 7q11.23, is characterized by profound impairments in visuo-spatial abilities, but relatively spared face recognition skills. Further, individuals with WS tend to display “hyper-social’ behavior, the hallmark of which is a preference for, and increased attention to, human faces relative to other visual stimuli. While previous studies have assessed short- and long- term auditory and visuo-spatial memory in WS, memory for faces has not been explored. Participants completed the immediate and delayed (30 minutes) conditions of three subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale - 3rd Edition, including one auditory memory (Logical Memory) and two visual memory (Faces & Family Pictures) subtests. Performance of the WS group was compared to that of age-, gender-, and IQ- matched individuals with developmental disorders of unspecified etiologies (DD). While in the visual domain, results revealed no significant differences between WS and DD groups on immediate or delayed memory for Family Pictures, the WS group performed significantly better than the DD group on immediate and delayed memory for Faces. These results suggest that the relative strength in face processing in WS extends to memory for faces. H127 AGE RELATED CHANGES IN TOP-DOWN MODULATION OF LOW-LEVEL VISUAL PROCESSING Theodore Zanto1, Brian Toy1, Adam Gazzaley1; 1University of California San Francisco — Top-down modulation refers to our ability to focus attention on task-relevant stimuli while ignoring irrelevant distractions and it shares an intimate relationship with memory, as the focus of attention will restrict content to relevant information and limit interference from irrelevant stimuli. In the current study, we assessed the influence of aging on the relationship between top-down modulation during low-level (i.e. color or motion) visual processing and working memory (WM), as it has been shown that older adults exhibit slower processing speeds and deficits in WM and attention. Subjects were between 18-35 y.o. and 60-80 y.o. Both age groups were presented sequential, random-dot circular apertures that contained stationary colored dots or gray dots that moved coherently in one direction. Each trial contained two different directions of motion and two different colors followed by a four second delay and a probe stimulus. Subjects were given four task conditions: remember the directions of motion (ignore color), remember the colors (ignore motion), remember both directions and colors, or passively view all stimuli. All subjects were pre-thresholded for discrimination and performance measures revealed a significant age-related decrease in WM for color, but an increased RT for both color and motion. Attentional (top-down) modulation was observed in posterior electrodes and did not differ in magnitude between the age groups. However, older subjects displayed longer reaction times and delayed neural responses as indexed by a shift in the selection negativity and alpha desynchronization. The relationship between delayed neural modulation and WM performance is being further explored. H128 DIRECT EVIDENCE FOR BINDING IN VISUAL WORKING MEMORY Weiwei Zhang1, Steven Luck1,2; 1Center for Mind & Brain, UC Davis, 2UC Davis — Most visual objects in the natural environment contain feature values along multiple dimensions. Luck & Vogel (Nature, 390, 1997, 279-281) argued for integrated object-based representations in visual working memory (VWM), and they showed that multi-feature objects can be held in visual working memory as well as single-feature objects. However, it is important to show that the features are actually bound together in some direct manner. In the present study, subjects made separate reports of the color and orientation of a previously pre-  \\x0cPoster Session H  sented bar. Feature binding was assessed on the basis of a contingency analysis of response accuracy. That is, when one feature is or is not remembered, is the other feature remembered? We found that memory for one feature of an object was strongly associated with memory for the other feature of the object. Furthermore, VWM precision and capacity were equivalent for single-feature and multiple-feature objects. These results therefore provided direct evidence for binding in VWM. Some constraints on VWM binding were also tested. In Experiment 2, we found that it was possible to represent one feature of an object without representing the other feature of that object when the other feature was selectively masked. In Experiment 3, we ruled out an alternative locationbased encoding account by showing that spatially overlapping colors & orientations that belonged to different objects were encoded into VWM independently. Taken together, these results provided direct evidence for automatic, flexible, and object-based feature binding in VWM. H130 A NEW MODEL AND TREATMENT FOR POST-STROKE TACTILE ALLODYNIA. Paul McGeoch1, Lisa Williams1, Vilayanur Ramachandran1; 1 Centre for Brain and Cognition, UCSD — Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) follows about 5% of all strokes and is characterised by severe, unrelenting pain throughout the contralateral half of the body, with sufferers also frequently complaining of an acute exacerbation of their pain to light touch; tactile allodynia. Whilst there is now significant evidence to support the thermosensory disinhibition hypothesis for the constant background pain in these patients, tactile allodynia has until now been something of an unexplained anomaly. We found using magnetoencephalography (MEG) that tactile allodynia in CPSP corresponds to activation of the primary motor cortex (M1) and subsequently the anterior cingulate cortex, which is known to be responsible for the motivational component of pain. Moreover, we also show that stimulation of the brain’s vestibular system can temporarily return the pattern of brain activation after light touch to normal (predominantly primary somatosensory cortex (S1) activation), with consequent relief of the persistent tactile allodynia. We propose a model for tactile allodynia in CPSP in which the interoceptive cortex in the dorsal posterior insula modulates activation of S1 and M1 in response to light touch. The evolutionary drive behind such a mechanism may have been to induce a sub-threshold activation of M1 to facilitate rapid corrective action when a deviation from homeostatic norms occurs. This model, not least with its suggestion of a sensory of role for M1, ties in with the modern view of the brain as a series of interconnected systems that serve several functions.  Tuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  revealed that a corresponding region of inferior medial PFC was recruited by healthy participants when determining whether imagined stimuli had been perceived or imagined, and that reduced activity in this region was associated with making “imagined-to-perceived” misattribution errors. These findings provide converging evidence from lesion and neuroimaging studies suggesting that reality monitoring abilities are associated with the inferior medial frontal lobe. An impairment in discriminating between real and imagined events might account for some confabulations seen in neurological patients with damage to inferior medial PFC. H132 LONG-LASTING EFFECTS OF A VISUALLY-ENHANCED STUDY CONDITION ON THE N400 AND P600 COMPONENTS. John Olichney1,2, Alexander Bressler3, James Gatherwright4, Hillert5, Shaiohui Chan1,2, Vincente Iragui5,3, Marta Kutas5,6; 1UC Davis, 2Center for Mind and Brain, Davis, CA, 3VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, 4School of Med., Case Western Reserve University, Cleaveland, OH, 5UCSD, , 6UCSD — Background: The P600 and N400 (sensitive to semantic processing) have both been linked to aspects of verbal learning or memory. While much is known regarding the modulation of these components by repeating stimuli within an experiment, little is known regarding the correlates of long-term learning. Thus, we designed a visually-enhanced study condition (VESC) in which color photographs of objects (semantically congruous or incongruous) were studied for 3.5 hours over 7 days preceding the Event-related potential (ERP) session. Methods: Ten normal young adults were studied with 32 channel ERP. 50% of the stimuli were semantically congruous vs. incongruous. Both studied and unstudied stimuli had a 67% probability of repeating (10-140 seconds later). Results: Prior visual study resulted in a large decrease of P600 amplitude for the initial presentation of congruous words. The amplitude of this decrement correlated with subsequent recall and recognition (r’s=.65.68). For incongruous words, smaller N400 and P600s were elicited by studied items. For unstudied new words, but not for initial presentations of studied words, larger N400s were elicited by incongruous than congruous words. Free recall was strongly correlated with the P600 word repetition effect amplitude (r =.84). Cued recall and recognition were strongly correlated with the N400 repetition effect amplitude (r’s =.86.91;p’s<0.001). Conclusions: Prior study of color photographs had large effects on ERPs obtained >12 hours later. Both the N400 and P600 showed sensitivity to the VESC. These data suggest that the VESC fostered memory “binding” and long-lasting semantic associations, even for incongruous material usually difficult to learn.  Memory: Memory disorders H131 CONFABULATION, REALITY MONITORING AND THE INFERIOR MEDIAL PFC: CONVERGING EVIDENCE FROM LESION AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING STUDIES. Martha Turner1, Paul Burgess1, Lisa Cipolotti2, Chris Frith3, Sam Gilbert1, Tim Shallice1, Jon Simons4; 1 Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL, London, 2National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, 3Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, UCL, London, 4University of Cambridge — Confabulation, the pathological production of false memories, occurs following a variety of etiologies involving the frontal lobes. However the critical frontal regions and specific cognitive deficits involved remain unclear. This poster reports three studies investigating the association between confabulation, reality monitoring abilities, and the inferior medial PFC. In the first, an investigation of the localization of confabulation in an unselected series of 38 patients with frontal lesions revealed an association with inferior medial lesions. In the second, an investigation of reality monitoring abilities in four spontaneously confabulating patients with damage to inferior medial PFC revealed a tendency to misidentify imagined events as real. In the third, an fMRI study  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  263  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 8:00 - 10:00 am  264  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session H  \\x0cPoster Session I Attentional processes: Auditory I1 EFFECTS OF TASK PERFORMANCE ON THE AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSE TO SPEECH Karen Banai1, Nina Kraus1; 1Northwestern University — Auditory processing in the human brainstem is influenced by non sensory factors such as music and language expertise. Whether it is also influenced online by auditory selective attention has been subject to much controversy and the prevailing view is that while auditory selective attention influences early cortical responses, it does not influence sub-cortical auditory processing. Here we used a dichotic listening oddball procedure to determine whether the scalp recorded auditory brainstem response to a speech syllable (speech-ABR) is affected by selective attention or active task performance. Speech-ABRs were recorded from 12 young adults in two conditions: an active listening condition in which listeners were asked to attend speech syllables presented to one ear and detect occasional targets differing in fundamental frequency while ignoring the same syllables presented to the other ear, and a passive listening condition in which the same stimuli were presented but listeners were not required to perform any task and could watch a silent movie. Active task performance resulted in a small but significant reduction in the amplitude of the brainstem response to both actively-attended and activelyignored standard sounds relative to passive listening, but not in a specific effect of attention. These data suggest that actively engaging in an auditory discrimination task can modulate sub-cortical processing of speech sounds in a task relevant manner; however, this modulation can not be attributed to selective attention because the effects of task performance are similar across the attended and ignored auditory channels. I2 GENETIC INFLUENCES ON SELECTIVE AUDITORY ATTENTION AS INDEXED BY ERPS Theodore Bell1, Laura Batterink1, Jeff Currin1, Eric Pakulak1, Courtney Stevens1,2, Helen Neville1; 1University of Oregon, 2Sarah Lawrence College — Recent electrophysiological work on selective attention has demonstrated that young children (3-5 years old) can selectively attend to one auditory stream while ignoring another (Sanders, Stevens, Coch, & Neville, 2005). The current work examines how selective attention indexed by event-related potentials (ERPs) may be influenced by genotype for a small set of genes implicated in cognition and attention. In a dichotic listening task designed for children, two stories were played simultaneously from speakers to the left and right of the listener. Children were cued to attend only one of the two stories and ERPs were recorded and compared for probe stimuli embedded in the attended versus unattended stories. We examined whether the ERP attentional modulation varied as a function of genotype. DNA was collected using buccal swabs and genotyped for the following genes: COMT, DAT1, DBH, DRD2, MAOA, and CHRNA4. The magnitude of the ERP attention effect varied significantly as a function of allelic variation in CHRNA4 and DAT1. I3 SPECTRAL ANALYSES OF THE TOP-DOWN CONTROL OF ATTENTION TO LINGUISTIC AND MUSICAL INFORMATION USING MEG Corby Dale1, Gregory Simpson1, Tracy Luks1, Anthony Kaveh1,2, Darren Weber1,3, Robert Zatorre4; 1University of California San Francisco, 2University of California, Berkeley, 3Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, 4Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University — Functional imaging studies demonstrate involvement of frontal, parietal and auditory association cortices in processing linguistic and musical pattern information. Some studies also find hemispheric asymmetries whereby language  is predominately processed in the left hemisphere and tonal patterns in the right. Less is known about the dynamics and patterns of activity between cortical regions, and how selective attention modulates this activity. We recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals from 12 right-handed volunteers performing a discrimination task requiring processing of linguistic information, simultaneous suppression of tonal pattern information, and vice versa. The two conditions used identical physical stimuli, differing only in instruction for which information to attend (tonal or linguistic). Subjects were visually instructed to task condition at the start of each block, after which they heard a series of compound stimuli containing one of two types of tonal pattern and either a word or non-word. Images of cortical currents were derived using cortically-constrained minimumnorm methods (BrainStorm) specific to the anatomy of each subject (Freesurfer) for an epoch of -500 to +600 ms. Dynamic maps of Event-related activity, spectral power and synchrony between brain areas were obtained for regions of interest (ROIs) in frontal, parietal and temporal cortex, defined by Talairach coordinates derived from task-relevant imaging (fMRI/PET) studies. Results reveal synchrony between frontal and temporal ROIs that reflects the interaction between top-down control of attention and auditory processing. Spectral analysis of attention to linguistic versus tonal pattern information indicates left-right hemisphere differences in dynamic interactions between cortical regions in different frequency bands. I4 EARLY GATING OF AUDITORY NOVELTY PROCESSING BY EMOTIONAL CONTEXT IN SUPERIOR TEMPORAL GYRUS Judith Domínguez-Borràs1, Manuel Garcia-Garcia1, Sina Alexa Trautmann2,3, Peter Erhard3,4, Thorsten Fehr2,3, Manfred Herrmann2,3, Carles Escera1,5; 1Cognitive Neuroscience Research Group, University of Barcelona, Spain, 2Institute for Cognitive Neuroscience, Bremen University, Germany, 3Center for Advanced Imaging, Bremen University, Germany, 4Bremen University, Germany, 5HanseWissenschaftskolleg, Delmenhorst, Germany — We conducted two experiments, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eventrelated brain potentials (ERPs), respectively, to asses the neural correlates, timing and modulatory effects of a negative emotional context on the processing of task-irrelevant novel sounds. In Study I, seventeen healthy volunteers responded to a visual color discrimination task, with images of emotional facial expressions (angry, fearful or neutral), while recorded in a 3Tesla scanner. In Study II, fourteen healthy volunteers responded to a visual discrimination task, with either neutral or threatening sceneries, while a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. In both studies, single auditory stimuli, consisting of either standard tones (700Hz, p=0.8) or unique environmental novel sounds (p=0.2), preceded the images in 300 ms and had to be ignored by the subjects. Novel sounds elicited a distractor effect on subjects’ performance, reflected by longer response times (Study I: F(1,16)=35.93, p<0.001; Study II: F(1,13)=11.61, p<0.01). This effect was enhanced when preceding and following images were negative (Study I: F(1,16)=5.3, p=0.035; Study II: F(1,13)=6.4, p=0.025). In study I, bilateral superior temporal gyri, areas known to be involved in auditory novelty processing, were more activated in negative context (p<0.001, k=20). Accordingly, in study II, early novelty-P3 responses to novel sounds were enhanced in negative context (F(1,13)=9.52, p=0.009). Our data show that the emotional context enhances excitability of auditory novelty cerebral regions at early stages of the orientation response, making irrelevant sounds become more available in the attentional set under threatening conditions.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  265  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I5 REORIENTING NEGATIVITY: AN ERP CORRELATE OF OBJECTFILE UPDATING? János Horváth1, Urte Roeber1, Alexandra Bendixen1, Erich Schröger1; 1Institute of Psychology I, University of Leipzig, Leipzig — Distraction triggered by unexpected stimuli is often investigated in oddball paradigms. Distraction-related processes initiated by infrequent, unexpected stimuli (deviants) presented amongst regular stimuli (standards) are reflected by a number of event-related potential (ERP) components. Deviants usually elicit an N1-increment, a modality-specific mismatch negativity (MMN), and a P3a. If participants have to perform a task based on a feature unrelated to the deviant feature on every trial (including deviant trials), deviants elicit an additional late frontal negativity termed Reorienting Negativity (RON), which is thought to reflect recovery from distraction. In the present study we investigated the necessary conditions for the elicitation of RON, using a pitch discrimination task. In Condition 1, standards were high or low tones (45-45%), and deviants were extremely high or extremely low tones(5-5%). In Condition 2, both standards and deviants were extremely high- or extremely low-pitched tones, but deviants differed from standards in their spectral width. In Condition 3, standards were high or low tones; deviants were extremely high or low and their spectral width differed from that of standards. Whereas deviants elicited an N1-increment/MMN and P3a in all conditions, RON was only elicited in Condition 2, suggesting that RON is elicited only if the task-relevant feature-level in the deviants is the same as in standards. A new hypothesis on the functional significance of RON is suggested: RON might reflect the update of an object-file, and not the restoration of the task-optimal attention set. I6 SELECTIVE ATTENTION TO ONE OF TWO COMPETING AUDITORY RHYTHMS MODULATES PHASE OF BRAIN RESPONSES TO THE ATTENDED RHYTHM John Iversen1, Aniruddh Patel1, Yanqing Chen1, Joseph Gally1, Gerald Edelman1; 1The Neurosciences Institute — When listening to multiple competing sounds, what brain mechanisms might enable us to attend to one sound while resisting the influence of other sounds? We addressed this question by measuring brain responses while participants tapped along with one of two simultaneously presented metronomes. An underlying question is whether selective attention is mediated by the amount of stimulusrelated brain activity or by the temporal pattern of this activity. Participants (n=14) were presented with two stimuli, dichotically. Stimuli were a sinusoidal carrier (800 or 400Hz) with an isochronous rhythm impressed by transiently increasing the amplitude, with an inter-onset interval of 801 or 751 ms, respectively. During twenty 60 second trials, participants were instructed to tap in synchrony with one of the stimuli (target) while ignoring the other (distractor). To enable the independent measurement of brain responses to the two stimuli, each was sinusoidally amplitude modulated at a different frequency (typically 38 and 42Hz). Auditory cortex steady state responses (aSSRs) were measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG), and compared between target and distractor trials for each stimulus. Tap timing data were simultaneously collected. The phase of the aSSR was consistently slightly delayed by attention (mean delay across participants ~5 degrees, p<0.023). In contrast, neither power nor partial coherence were affected by attention, suggesting that only the timing of brain responses is modulated by attention in this task. Results from a new diotic version of this task will be compared to the current findings. Supported by Neurosciences Research Foundation. I7 HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND THE AUDITORY EVENT RELATED BRAIN POTENTIAL Gregory Kellett1, Erin Ramage1, Mark Geisler1; 1San Francisco State University — The autonomic nervous system (ANS) often responds to cognitive events via physiological activity. Likewise, acute ANS activity has been shown to affect cognitive functioning both hormonally and neurally. This study investigates the possible co-  266  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  variation of chronic ANS activity, or tone, with the cognitive indicator of neuronal resource allocation and processing speed as indexed by auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants included 30 healthy men and women equally represented and between the ages of 18 and 35. Heart Rate Variability (HRV), measured by the standard deviation of inter-beat intervals and correlated with sympathetic and parasympathetic ANS activity, was established via ten minute heart rate readings taken from wrist electrodes. High HRV is associated with healthy cardiovascular activity while low HRV is associated with poor cardiovascular activity. ERPs were then recorded from multiple electrode sites using a 16 channel electrode cap representing a full distribution of the scalp in response to an auditory oddball paradigm. Possible correlations between the ERP’s and the standard deviation of HRV within each participant was investigated. Preliminary results show a lack of significant correlations between the heart rate variability and the amplitude and latency of the P3 component of the ERPs. These results are consistent with previous research which has also shown a lack of co-variation between similar indicators of ANS tone and ERPs. I8 MEANINGFUL AUDITORY CONTEXT AFFECTS PREATTENTIVE AUDITORY DEVIANCE DETECTION Ursula Kirmse1, Erich Schröger1, Thomas Jacobsen1; 1Institute for Psychology I, University of Leipzig — Auditory deviance detection is reflected by the pre-attentively elicited Mismatch Negativity (MMN), a negative ERP component observed for a deviant in a sequence of standard sounds. Recent studies found an enhanced MMN in a sequence of familiar in contrast to unfamiliar standard sounds, and concluded an enhanced MMN in a familiar context, which might lead to more elaborate processing of the auditory input. However, the effect here might originate from a generally different quality of sound representation for familiar sounds as documented in other studies. A genuine effect of context familiarity, in contrast, could be stated when auditory context familiarity is varied outside the standarddeviant sequence. In the present study, a frequency oddball protocol (standard 550 Hz, deviant 500 Hz) was presented simultaneously with continuous speech that was either presented forwards (= familiar, meaningful context) or backwards (= unfamiliar, non-meaningful context). Participants either ignored both streams or detected target words in either text. Results showed that the additional secondary text stream generally diminished the MMN to the frequency deviants compared to a nocontext control condition. However, larger MMN responses to the frequency deviants were observed in the familiar context, reflecting a genuine effect of context familiarity on the MMN. The data did not support the notion that this effect might have been due to increased attention to the familiar text stream. Additionally, behavioral and ERP data indicated that even active target word detection was easier in the familiar context. I9 A QUESTION OF RELEVANCE: IS SUCCESSFUL COGNITIVE AGING ASSOCIATED WITH PRESERVED INHIBITORY CAPACITY AND ORIENTING ABILITY? Scott M. McGinnis1,2, Jenna L. Riis1,2, David A. Wolk3, Hyemi Chong4, Dorene M. Rentz1,2, Phillip R. Holcomb5, Kirk R. Daffner1,2; 1Harvard Medical School, 2Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital, 3University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 4University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, 5Tufts University — Research has suggested an age-related decrease in the capacity to inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli, which some investigators have argued plays a major role in cognitive aging. Work in our lab has indicated that cognitively high-performing old adults pay more attention to novel aspects of their visual environment than cognitively average-performing old adults. Here, we examined the impact of age and cognitive functioning (defined by performance on neuropsychological measures) on the amplitude of the N1 to repetitive auditory standard stimuli and the P3a to highly unusual novel auditory stimuli presented in a task-irrelevant sensory channel. Young adults, cognitively high-performing old adults, and cognitively average-performing old adults carried out a visual n-back task,  \\x0cPoster Session I  during which they were exposed to frequent standard tones, rare tones, and infrequent novel sounds. The N1 amplitude to standard tones was larger in old than young adults. There was no difference in N1 amplitude between high and average-performing old adults. In contrast, high-performing old adults generated a P3a to novel sounds that was larger than average-performing old adults, and comparable to young adults. These results suggest that: (1) old adults are less able than young adults to suppress the processing of task-irrelevant auditory standards, 2) this reduction in inhibitory capacity does not appear to be a major factor that distinguishes cognitively high from cognitively average-performing old adults, and (3) compared to average-performing old adults, high-performing old adults may have more resources available to process potentially significant novel stimuli presented in a task-irrelevant channel. I10 THE EFFECTS OF A VIDEO SOUNDTRACK ON THE PROCESSING OF IRRELEVANT ACOUSTIC CHANGES: A MISMATCH NEGATIVITY STUDY Patricia Moreau1,2, Isabelle Peretz1,2, Pierre Jolicoeur1,2, Nathalie Gosselin1,2; 1BRAMS (Brain, Music, and Sound), Montreal, 2CERNEC (Centre de recherche en neuropsychologie et cognition), Université de Montréal, Montreal — The mismatch negativity (MMN) is typically elicited by measuring the difference in the eventrelated potential (ERP) to frequently repeated auditory stimuli from the ERP to rare deviant auditory stimuli. Often these stimuli are presented in non-attentive conditions while subjects are being distracted by a variety of tasks and are instructed to ignore the auditory stimulation. MMN has been argued to be attention independent; however it is not yet clear if the type of task used to distract the subject from the auditory stimulation can influence MMN recording. In this study, we examined the effects of presenting a movie with the audio soundtrack on the mismatch negativity (MMN). In three experiments we measured the MMN to tones that differed in pitch from a repeated standard tone presented in silence, with a concurrent soundtrack played either forward or backward, or with soundtracks set at different intensities (producing different signal-tonoise ratios of the MMN-critical tones relative to the soundtrack). In each experiment we measured a reliable MMN despite the concurrent soundtrack; however the amplitude of the MMN was reduced when the soundtrack was presented compared to silence. Generally, MMN amplitude increased proportionally to the increments in the signal-to-noise intensity ratio. These results likely reflect an acoustical interference effect of the audio soundtrack with MMN-critical tones rather than to an auditory attentionnal effect. I11 TEMPORALLY SELECTIVE ATTENTION DIRECTED BY EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION AND PRECEDING RHYTHMS Nicolas Planet1, Lisa D. Sanders1; 1University of Massachusetts, Amherst — Previous studies have shown that directing attention to specific time points modulates early auditory evoked potentials. However, temporal judgments are much more precise when participants are provided a rhythmic structure rather than a single marker of interval onset. The current study was designed to compare the effectiveness of rhythmic and single onset cues at directing temporally selective attention and to assess any interactions between cues. In instruction blocks, participants were asked to attend to a time 500 or 800 ms after the onset of a visual cue and to press a button if the deviant sound (20%) was heard at the attended time only. In rhythm blocks, listeners were instructed to attend to the next beat in a structure provided by flashing the visual cue five times with onset asynchronies of 500 or 800 ms. In interaction blocks, participants were instructed to attend to a time 500 or 800 ms after the last visual flash regardless of rhythmic structure. Visual onsets were consistent with the attended time, consistent with the unattended time, or had no rhythmic structure. Standard sounds presented 500 ms after fixation onset elicited a larger negativity in the N1 and P2 time range when temporally selective attention was directed to that time by instruction or rhythm, indicating that both are effective cues. Further, listeners were able to ignore the preceding  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  visual rhythms when instructed to attend to a specific time as evidenced by similar auditory attention effects across the interaction blocks. I12 ATTENTION ENHANCES MEG RECORDED GAMMA-BAND AUDITORY STEADY-STATE RESPONSE Bernhard Ross1,2, Steven Hillyard3, Terence Picton1,2; 1Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Centre, Toronto, 2 University of Toronto, ON, 3University of California, San Diego — Gammaband oscillations (>30Hz) have been associated with perceptual binding of stimulus features into an object. Selective attention is strongly connected to binding when focusing on target features while ignoring irrelevant information. We investigated the effect of attention on 40-Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) as a model of gamma-band oscillations. Human magnetoencephalography was recorded while young adults listened to monaural sequences of 500-Hz tones with 40-Hz amplitude modulation (AM). In attended condition subjects responded with right-hand button press to 10% of the stimuli with 30-Hz modulation. In non-attended condition, only the 40-Hz AM tones were presented for 5 min while the subjects watched a series of photographs (one per 3 s) and counted four categories of visual objects. Eight blocks of each attended and non-attended conditions were recorded using left and right monaural stimulation respectively. The ASSR assessed by sources in bilateral auditory cortices were significantly larger in attended condition compared to non-attended condition, while the effect was more expressed in the contra-lateral hemisphere and to left ear stimulation. As even stronger effect of attention the sustained response were strongly enhanced. However, attentional enhancement of transient gamma-band response were small (40-80 Hz) or even not detectable (24-28 Hz). The results confirm that steady-state gamma-band oscillation is functionally dissociated from transient components. Modulation of sustained rather than transient responses was interpreted as indicating involvement of top-down attentional control. I13 SUBJECTIVE RHYTHMISATION AS A PARADIGM FOR AN EEGDRIVEN BCI Rebecca Schaefer1, Rutger Vlek1, Peter Desain1; 1Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen Institute for Cognition and Information — In the so-called clock illusion, isochronous stimulus trains are subjectively grouped into a binary percept (tick-tick-tick-tick becomes tick-tock-ticktock). This subjective accenting, comparable to serial selective attention, has previously been shown to be visible in the EEG-signal [cf. Psychological Science, 14 (2003), 362; Cognitive Brain Research, 24 (2005), 117]. To use this manifestation to drive a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), we measured EEG after instructing participants to imagine different groupings superimposed on an isochronous train of stimuli, thus producing accented and non-accented beats in identical metronome ticks. Binary, ternary and quaternary metric patterns were investigated, including both a perception part with real accents and an imagery part with subjective accents. Testing contrasting hypotheses, namely structural isomorphism on one end and gestalt perception on the other would reveal unseen patterns that are useful in single trial classification of separate events. Analyses in both the ERP and time-frequency domain reveal substantial differences over participants that indicate a high level of individuality in the brain response to this serial selective attention task, but significant within-subject patterns. As realization of a BCI system only requires robust within-subject consistency, the results appear promising. Next steps will focus on detecting periodicity and single-trial classification of single beats. I14 NEURAL UNDERPINNINGS OF AUDITORY ATTENTIONAL BLINK Dawei Shen1, Claude Alain1,2; 1Rotman Research Institute, Bacrest Centre, 2University of Toronto, Ontario — The attentional blink (AB) is a phenomenon where the correct identification of the first target (target) causes a processing deficit of the second target (probe) when the two targets are to be presented among a rapid speed visual presentation. The AB can last several hundred milliseconds and provides important informa-  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  267  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  tion about the deployment of attention overtime. Recently, behavioral studies (e.g., Shen & Mondor, 2006) have revealed the magnitude of the auditory AB is affected by the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between two successive items within a sequence. In the present study we investigated the processing stage at which the auditory AB occurs by measuring scalp recorded auditory evoked potentials. On each trial, participants were required to detect predefined target and probe sounds presented in a rapid series of distractor sounds with short (90 ms), intermediate (120 ms), and long SOA (150 ms). The results showed a large AB when the SOA was short (i.e., 90 ms), and it decreased with increasing the SOA. This SOA-related decrease in the auditory AB was paralleled by an increase in P3b amplitude at electrode Pz. The latency of the P3b elicited by the probe following the target was delayed relative to the P3b elicited by probe alone. Regardless of the SOA, the probe elicited N1 and P2 waves at electrode C3, indicating that the probe was perceived in auditory cortex during the AB. These results suggest that the auditory AB reflects a limitation of short-term consolidation. I15 MODULATION OF LATERALIZATION OF AUDITORY CORTICAL RESPONSES BY SPATIAL ATTENTION Nathan Weisz1, Bertrand Olivier1; 1INSERM U821, Lyon, France — Several studies show a stronger left-hemispheric modulation of neuronal activity by selective attention. However these works have not looked at spatial attention. Here we monaurally presented a cue sound before onset of a compound sound. The second sound included a target modulation frequency (42 Hz) on one ear and a distractor (19 Hz) on the opposite side. Participants indicated on which ear they perceived the target. The cue was informative (75%) of target location in one condition and uninformative (50%) in the other. During the task we measured neuronal activity from 275 gradiometers projected onto a source montage. Our analysis focussed on alpha band changes, as well as target evoked steady-state responses (SSR). Behavioral responses were more accurate and faster when cue and target side were congruent or less accurate when incongruent only in the informative condition. Target related alpha desynchronization showed a lateralization only when the preceding cue was informative, which was largely driven by right-hemispheric modulations. For the SSR a conditions differences were only observed when the cue was presented to the left ear. This stems mainly from a predominant right-lateralized SSR when the preceding cue was uninformative. Our study is the first to show that auditory SSRs and alpha desynchronization can be modulated in a top-down manner. We hypothesize that our data reflect a \"default\" (bottom-up) processing advantage for stimuli presented to the left, that has to be actively suppressed for stimuli presented to the right. I16 STIMULUS AND ATTENTION EFFECTS ON SOUND ACTIVATIONS IN HUMAN AUDITORY CORTEX David L. Woods1,2,3, G. Christopher Stecker4, Teemu Rinne5, Anthony Cate1, Isaac Liao3, Timothy Herron1, Xiaojian Kang1, E. William Yund1; 1Hcnlab, Vanchcs, Martinez, CA, 2UC Davis, 3Center for Mind and Brain, UC Davis, 4University of Washington, Seattle, 5University of Helsinki, Helsinki , Finland — Previous fMRI studies have shown that activations of auditory cortex vary with the frequency, intensity, and location of sounds and with attention. We present a group analysis of auditory cortical activations in nine subjects who participated in a factorial experiment that varied these factors conjointly. Each subject was scanned on six separate sessions, three with sparse (TR=11.6s) and three with continuous (TR=2.9s) sampling. Activations were analyzed using cortical-surface mapping tools. Subjects attended to visual or auditory stimuli in separate blocks and performed a difficult one-back matching task in the attended modality. Unimodal stimulus sequences were included to isolate auditory stimulus-dependent activations (SDAs) by subtracting activations in visual-attention blocks without auditory stimuli from those in visual-attention blocks with concurrent sounds. Auditory SDAs were restricted to Heschl’s gyrus (HG) and the adjacent superior temporal gyrus (STG) and were  268  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  larger during sparse than continuous sampling. Low-frequency tones (~225 Hz) produced more extensive SDAs than loudness-matched highfrequency tones (~3600 Hz), particularly in mid-HG. Contralateral presentations enhanced SDAs throughout HG/STG, whereas increasing intensity (70 to 90 dB SPL) enhanced SDAs in medial HG. Attentionrelated modulations (ARMs) were isolated by subtracting activations in bimodal attend-visual blocks from those in bimodal attend-auditory blocks. ARMs were largest in lateral STG with little enhancement seen in medial HG. Additional analyses revealed further dissociations between ARMs and SDAs. For example, ARMs to monaural tones were enhanced in auditory cortex ipsilateral to stimulation. Auditory attention does not simply amplify auditory sensory responses but dynamically modulates processing in higher-order auditory cortical fields. I17 THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF LISTENING TO VERSUS HEARING WORDS: ATTENTION MODULATES BOTH EARLY STIMULUS ENCODING AND PREPARATORY ACTIVITY Yuliya Yoncheva1, Urs Maurer1,2, Zeeba Daruwalla1, Jason Zevin1, Bruce McCandliss1; 1Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, 2University of Zurich, Switzerland — Top-down attention to linguistic information modulates BOLD responses in a network including inferior frontal, temporal, and fusiform regions. The current study employs electroencephalography to investigate the temporal dynamics when attending to language, specifically to disentangle early influences on stimulus encoding from later decision-making processes and to assess differential preparatory activity. To isolate the impact of top-down attention we present pairs of chimeric stimuli – tone triplets embedded in auditory words – and contrast ERP responses during two tasks: linguistic (rhyme judgment) versus other auditory (tone-triplet matching) performed on the same stimuli. As revealed by a Topographic Analysis of Variance, linguistic focus drove divergence in the response to the first auditory stimulus, evident as early as ~100 msec after stimulus onset and spanning the whole 550-msec stimulus duration. Similar modulation of early stimulus encoding, encompassing the typical N1/P2/N2 auditory responses, was also present for the second stimulus. The anticipation period between the first and second stimuli was dominated, in both tasks, by strong contingent negative variation (CNV) that showed a significant shift in topography by task focus. This robust attentional effect manifested along the anterior-posterior axis suggesting differential contributions of frontal and posterior sources based on the need for maintenance of linguistic versus non-linguistic attentional set. The present findings suggest that attention to the linguistic aspects of complex auditory signals influences both on-line stimulus encoding operations as well as functions involved in maintaining relevant information for future comparisons. This work may inform the contributions and interactions of attentional mechanisms active during language processing. I18 ATTENTION EFFECTS OF THE AUDITORY STEADY-STATE RESPONSE IN THE EEG EVOKED BY ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL SOUNDS Katja Saupe1, Andreas Widmann1, Alexandra Bendixen1, Matthias Müller1, Erich Schröger1; 1Institute of Psychology I, University of Leipzig, Germany — Isochronous modulations in a sound elicit the Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) in the EEG and MEG, with an optimal modulation frequency of 40-Hz. Examinations of the effect of attention on the Auditory steady-state responses have proven inconsistent. The present study investigates whether the ASSR is enhanced with attention (as is the case for steady-state visual evoked potentials), but in contrast to further studies, not only when evoked by artificial but also by more natural sounds. 500-Hz tones and natural noise sounds with a 40-Hz amplitude modulation served as stimuli. In the attend condition, a modulation discrimination task was performed (infrequent targets were 30-Hz modulated sounds). In the un-attend condition, the subjects performed a visual discrimination task (detect occasional tiny changes in a fixation cross).  \\x0cPoster Session I  We found a 40-Hz ASSR not only for artificial but also for complex noise sounds. An attentional modulation of the ASSR was however only obtained for artificial sounds. These results illustrate, once more, the inconsistency in finding attention effects on the auditory ASSR, yet at the same time show, that such modulations are possible. Thus, ASSR may provide a useful tool for the investigation of auditory attention in the future.  Attentional processes: Other I19 ATTENTION TO HIERARCHICAL LEVELS AFFECTS CORTICAL PROCESSING ACROSS MODALITY AND DIMENSION Lori B. Astheimer1, Ahren Fitzroy1, Lisa D. Sanders1, Matthew C. Davidson1; 1University of Massachusetts, Amherst — Several lines of evidence indicate there is cortical specialization for processing hierarchical stimuli such that local information is preferentially processed in the left hemisphere and global information in the right hemisphere. However, it is not clear if lateralization of local and global processing is limited to visual spatial information or is a general organizational principle of the brain. Previous behavioral and ERP studies suggest attention can be directed to distinct hierarchical levels (defined by frequency or time) of auditory stimuli, but have not definitively shown if doing so leads to lateralization of processing. To index lateralization of local and global processing across stimulus modality (visual/auditory) and hierarchical dimension (space/time), fMRI data were collected while participants observed three types of hierarchical displays: 1) static visual images of ten small arrows combined to form a large arrow, 2) 40 ms frequency modulated sounds combined into 500 ms series that increased or decreased in pitch, and 3) a light that moved on the vertical midline such that the overall motion was made up of shorter paths. In separate blocks, participants were instructed to attend to the local or global features and to report the direction (up or down) at that level of the hierarchical display. An additional baseline condition required participants to press a button as quickly as possible in response to any stimulus. Analyses of BOLD signals revealed differential brain activation according to attention condition, stimulus modality, and hierarchical dimension in areas associated with sensory processing and attentional control. I20 FUNCTIONAL BRAIN ACTIVATION IN YOUNG ADULTS WITH ADHD: A RESTRICTED RANGE OF DYNAMIC RESPONSE? Marie T. Banich1,2,3, Gregory C. Burgess1, Brendan Depue1, Blaine Ames1, Luka Ruzic1, Erik Willcutt1; 1University of Colorado at Boulder, 2Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado at Boulder, 3University of Colorado at Denver — Relatively little is known about patterns of brain activation in adults with ADHD during performance of attentionally-demanding tasks. In this study we compared brain activation in 23 young adults with ADHD, who were carefully screened to not have co-morbid psychiatric disorders, and 23 age matched controls. All participants performed a hybrid blocked/event-related version of the Stroop task composed of neutral (e.g., “sum” in red ink), congruent (e.g., “red” in red ink) and incongruent (e.g., “blue” in red ink) blocks of trials. Within each block, half the trials were block specific (e.g. incongruent words) and half were a set of neutral trials that occurred across all blocks. In addition, blocks of fixation trials served as a low-level baseline. In the comparison of each block type with the fixation baseline, ADHD individuals exhibited less activity in prefrontal regions associated with attentional control. They appear to have difficulty tonically directing attention towards ink color identification and away from word reading. With regards to eventrelated comparisons of incongruent trials to neutral trials within the incongruent block, ADHD individuals exhibited less activation in caudal regions of the anterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that brain systems involved in attentional control act atypically in adults with  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  ADHD both with regards to tonic top-down regulation of attentional resources and with phasic aspects of attentional control. Their inability to recruit attentional areas to meet both tonic and phasic aspects of attentional control seems to occur as a result of a restricted dynamic range of response. I21 PREPARATORY MEG ACTIVITIES DURING CUED SPATIAL ATTENTION TO AUDITORY OR VISUAL STIMULI Olivier Bertrand1, Nathan Weisz1, Nelly Mainy1, Claude Delpuech1,2, Françoise Bauchet2, Jean-Philippe Lachaux1; 1INSERM U821, University Lyon 1, France, 2CERMEP, Lyon, France — Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that sensory processing can be strongly affected by attention, acting either on preparatory endogeneous processes or directly on the processing of the actual incoming stimulus. Our goal was to characterize MEG correlates of endogenous spatial attention for audition and vision. We examined activity following attention-directing cues, symbolically instructing subjects to attend to one modality (auditory or visual) and to one hemifield, and to perform a simple reaction time task after stimulus presentation. A 1s-duration central visual cue indicated whether the subsequent stimulus would be auditory or visual, and left or right sided. The cue diminished reaction times to both visual and auditory stimuli in the valid trials (80% of the trials). Those facilitation effects were observed for modality and lateralization, indicating an effective attentional manipulation. Transient, sustained and oscillatory MEG activities (275-channel VSM-CTF) were analyzed during cue presentation and delay period prior to the imperative stimulus. The transient responses to cue onset showed a predominance controlateral to the cued side. During cue processing and the delay period, an alpha desynchronisation over parieto-occipital cortices was observed controlaterally to the cued side. At the end of the delay period, the sustain responses over the temporal cortices were increased when attention is cued to the auditory modality. This study allowed to disentangle the timing and the respective contribution of overlapping networks during the preparatory period, either involving general attention and motor preparation processes, or implicating perceptual-related areas, later involved in the processing of the attended stimulus. I22 NORMAL AGING AND FEATURE BINDING: IMPLICATIONS FOR CHOLINERGIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ATTENTION Leigh C.P. Botly1, Matthew L. Dixon1, Eve De Rosa1,2; 1University of Toronto, St. George, 2Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Center for Geriatric Care — The binding problem refers to the fundamental challenge of the central nervous system to integrate sensory information to form a unified percept. It is commonly accepted that feature-conjunction (FC) stimuli require feature binding and are attention-dependent, while feature-singleton (FS) stimuli only require the processing of single features and are much less attentiondependent. We previously demonstrated a critical role for the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) in feature binding in rats, and proposed that ACh facilitates this cognitive process by modulating attentional processes at encoding. Given this finding and the recognized decline in cholinergic function during normal aging, we expected that young adults only under divided attention and older adults under full attention would be impaired at acquiring an FC task relative to an FS task. Thus, we tested thirty-one young adults (X= 19.2 years, S.D. = 1.1) while performing a concurrent divided attention task and forty-one older (X= 75.2 years, S.D. = 5.4) adults under full attention during acquisition of the visual FC and FS tasks. As hypothesized, both groups were comparably impaired at acquiring the FC task relative to the FS task; additionally, this pattern of behaviour is strikingly similar to that of rats under the influence of the cholinergic muscarinic antagonist scopolamine while they acquired comparable FC and FS tasks. Collectively, these data illustrate the susceptibility of the feature binding process to attentional challenges induced pharmacologically, behaviourally, or as the result of normal aging. And therefore lend further support for ACh’s role in the attentional modulation of learning.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  269  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I23 ANTICIPATING CONFLICT SPEEDS-UP EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS LINKED TO CONFLICT DETECTION Angel Correa1,2, Anling Rao2, Anna Nobre2; 1University of Granada, Spain, 2University of Oxford, United Kingdom — Cognitive control can be triggered in reaction to previous conflict, as suggested by the finding of sequential effects in conflict tasks. Can control be also triggered proactively by presenting cues predicting conflict (‘proactive control’)? We exploited the high temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERPs) and controlled for sequential effects to ask whether proactive control based on anticipating conflict modulates neural activity related to cognitive control. ERPs associated with conflict detection (N2) were measured during a cued flanker task. Symbolic cues were either informative or neutral with respect to whether the target involved conflicting or congruent responses. Sequential effects were controlled by analysing the congruency of the previous trial. The results showed that cuing conflict reduced both the behavioural conflict effect and the N2 latency. Other potentials less specifically related to conflict processing, such as the frontal N1 and the P3, were also modulated by cuing conflict. Cuing effects were most evident after congruent than after incongruent trials. This interaction between cuing and sequential effects suggests neural overlap between the control networks triggered by proactive and reactive signals. This finding then clarifies why previous (fMRI) studies, not controlling for reactive sequential effects, have rarely found that proactive control attenuates ACC conflict-related activity. Finally, the high temporal resolution of ERPs was critical to reveal a temporal modulation of conflict detection by proactive control. This novel finding suggests that anticipating conflict speeds-up conflict detection. Recent research suggests that this anticipatory mechanism may be mediated by pre-activation of the ACC during the preparatory interval. I24 EXAMINING THE ATTENTIONAL COSTS OF SELF-FOCUSED ATTENTION Katrina Fincher1, Amishi Jha1; 1Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania — We examined the hypothesis that self-focused attention competes for attentional resources necessary to attend and interact with the external environment. In Condition A, subjects (n = 25) rated the valence of adjectives using a 4 point Likert scale. In Condition B, these words were presented as task-irrelevant distractors at fixation as subjects performed a simple visual discrimation task for peripheral stimuli. There was no significant main effect of valence ratings on discrimination performance. In Condition C, subjects rated the selfrelevance of adjectives. In Condition D, similar to Condition B, these words were presented as task-irrelevant distractors during a simple visual discrimination task. There was no main effect of self ratings on discrimination performance. Importantly, response times (RTs) during word rating in Condition C were slowest when the words were either rated as high in self-relevance and negative (determined by Condition A) or low in self-relevance and positive. This slowing may reflect high cognitive and affective conflict associated with these word categories which may heighten self-focused attention. We therefore predicted that these “high conflict” words would result in slower discrimination performance in Condition D as attention becomes usurped by self-focused processes initiated by the word presentation. Indeed, during Condition D, RTs were significantly slower for high vs. low conflict distractor words, and the magnitude of this effect correlated with the subject’s degree of depression, anxiety, and rumination as indexed by self-report measures. Thus, self-focused distraction may have deleterious effects on attention to external tasks as well as overall mental health. I25 ELECTRICAL CORRELATES OF THE RESTING STATE NETWORK IN MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX IN HUMANS Kristie J. Fisher1,2, Kai J. Miller1,3, Jeffrey G. Ojemann1,4; 1University of Washington, 2 Psychology, 3Neurobiology and Behavior, 4Neurological Surgery — We investigated changes in the dynamics of the resting state (\"default\") net-  270  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  work in medial prefrontal cortex in humans (Gusnard, NatRevNeuro, 2001), using the fine temporal resolution of electrocorticography (ECoG). We studied 5 human subjects, with ECoG electrodes in dorsal and ventral medial pre-frontal cortex. We performed a comparison between fixation (\"disengagement\") and one of three \"engagement\" tasks. The engagement task was dependent on the placement of the other elements of the electrode array: a) Language (verb generation task with electrodes in left fronto-temporal-parietal areas), b) Memory (n-back visual working memory task with electrodes in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), c) Target Detection task (noise-masked faces and houses with electrodes in the subtemporal fusiform areas). We see the hallmarks of default network cortical activity during non-engagement using these metrics: 1) band specific power (Miller, 2007, NeuroImage), 2) phase-amplitude coupling (Canolty, 2006, Science), 3) cross-coherence between neighboring electrodes. Consistent with a study by Mantini (Mantini, 2007, PNAS), we found band-specific changes in discrete rhythms. More importantly, we also found changes in the high frequency amplitude-low frequency phase coupling that we believe is the hallmark of coordination between cortex and subcortical control structures (thalamic, basal ganglial). Our study demonstrates the usefulness of high temporal resolution in identifying distinct, separable properties of brain activity that show characteristic electrical activity when not engaged in a cognitive task, and activity suppression during task engagement. I26 THE EFFECTS OF REFLECTIVE STATE ON PERCEPTUAL PROCESSING IN THE CONTEXT OF EMOTIONAL INFORMATION IN DYSPHORIA Sharmin Ghaznavi1, Susan NolenHoeksema1, Marcia K. Johnson1; 1Yale University — Theoretical accounts of depression (Beck, 1967; Bower, 1981; Teasdale, 1983) predict that depressed individuals will show selective attention to material congruent with depressed mood. However, findings from previous work on mood congruent attentional biases in depression are inconsistent across studies. One reason for the inconsistencies across studies may be differences in the reflective state of participants at the time of testing. The self-reflective state of rumination (e.g., focusing on symptoms of distress) worsens depression whereas distraction (e.g., focusing on non-self-relevant information) temporarily reduces depression. Whether depressed individuals are in a self-focused, ruminative state, or a distracted state may have consequences for the impact of emotional information on their cognitive processing in the context of negative emotional information. We investigated perceptual processing in dysphoric individuals (n = 30) and nondysphoric individuals (n = 30) while manipulating reflective state using an adaptation of a rumination/distraction state manipulation from Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema (1993). When negative emotional items were present in the task, dysphoric individuals were affected by the state induction on a perceptual task requiring them to process words for meaning (identifying an exemplar of a category), but not on a perceptual task requiring participants to attend to basic perceptual features of a word (letter case). State induction had no effect on performance in nondysphoric individuals. This evidence suggests that reflective state as well as the specific types of processing required influences how emotional information is processed by depressed individuals. I27 TACTILE REFLEXIVE ATTENTION; AN INVESTIGATION OF ITS TIME COURSE, AND ITS ROLE IN THE EXPERIENCE OF MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED SYMPTOMS. Eleanor Miles1, Ellen Poliakoff1, Richard Brown1; 1University of Manchester, UK — In the visual and auditory modalities, it has been demonstrated that peripheral cues facilitate responses to targets presented at the same location, which is thought to be due to reflexive (automatic) attention shifts. In the tactile modality, however, the only studies to demonstrate facilitation include potential methodological confounds (spatial discrimination tasks, or predictive cues) and involve processes in addition to reflexive attention. In the current study, we investigated the time course of tactile reflexive  \\x0cPoster Session I  attention by using a non-spatial tactile frequency discrimination task, following a non-informative tactile cue. When the target was presented 150 ms after the cue, we observed faster discrimination responses to targets presented on the same side (compared to the opposite side) as the cue; by 1000ms, responses were significantly faster to targets on the opposite side to the cue. Thus, we demonstrate that tactile attentional facilitation can be observed in a non-spatial discrimination task, and provide the first demonstration of significant tactile facilitation and tactile inhibition of return within a single experiment. These findings are discussed in relation to medically unexplained symptoms (symptoms for which no physical cause can be found). Theories suggest that people with a propensity to unexplained symptoms have an attentional bias for the body, and a recent model (Brown, 2004) suggests the underlying deficit may be in the ability to disengage from the body. As yet there is no empirical support for this, and investigation of tactile attention shifts in these patients may provide a way forward. I28 MADE YOU LOOK! IRRELEVANT INSTRUCTIONS HIJACK THE ATTENTIONAL NETWORK Katherine Moore1, Clare Porter1, Daniel Weissman1; 1University of Michigan at Ann Arbor — The ability to voluntarily orient attention when presented with an instructional cue (e.g., \"Listen to the teacher!\") is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. Much evidence indicates that this ability depends on a fronto-parietal network, which biases activity in sensory regions to enhance the processing of task-relevant stimuli. In the present fMRI study, we investigated whether task-irrelevant instructions (e.g., \"Look!\") can hijack the frontoparietal network, leading to greater processing of irrelevant features in the environment. In each trial, a visually-presented cue word (\"Look\" or \"Hear\") instructed participants to attend to either the visual or the auditory sensory modality for a possibly upcoming relevant letter (\"X or \"O\"), while ignoring a simultaneously-presented irrelevant letter (\"X\" or \"O\") in the opposite modality. Critically, the visually-presented cue word (e.g., \"Hear\") was accompanied by an irrelevant auditory instruction word that signaled either the same sensory modality as the visual cue (e.g., \"Hear\"; congruent cues) or a different modality (e.g., \"Look\"; incongruent cues). In line with our hypothesis that incongruent cues should interfere with processes that orient attention, we observed greater activity for incongruent than for congruent cues in multiple regions of the fronto-parietal network. Also in line with our hypothesis, incongruent cues evoked greater activity than congruent cues in sensory regions corresponding to the uncued modality. These findings show for the first time that irrelevant, consciously-perceived instruction words can hijack the fronto-parietal network, resulting in greater attention to task-irrelevant features of the environment. I29 INFLUENCE OF SPATIAL ATTENTION ON INTERHEMISPHERIC TRANSFER IN AN ACALLOSAL BRAIN Eric Mooshagian1, Marco Iacoboni1, Eran Zaidel1; 1University of California, Los Angeles — In a lateralized simple reaction time (SRT) paradigm, a stimulus presented to the right visual field (RVF) elicits faster right-hand (uncrossed) responses than left-hand (crossed) responses. In the uncrossed condition, the stimulus and response are processed within the left hemisphere. In the crossed condition, one hemisphere registers the stimulus while the other makes the response. The crossed-uncrossed difference (CUD) is taken as a measure of interhemispheric transfer time via the corpus callosum. However, the CUD in normal subjects has recently been demonstrated to be sensitive to spatial attention. When subjects used an unnatural, arms crossed position and pressed the left button with the right hand, etc., the CUD was reduced, indicating an influence of spatial attention (Mooshagian et al., in press). Using the same task, it has been demonstrated that an unnatural arms position reduces the CUD in a commissurotomy patient as well (Mooshagian et al., 2001). In the present experiment, we tested an acallosal subject, MM, using the same task. Results, again, indicate a reduced CUD in the unnatural arms position. Importantly, MM’s natural  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  and unnatural CUDs fall between those obtained for normal subjects and split-brain patients. This confirms that the CUD is not a pure measure of callosal relay. The CUD reflects both interhemispheric transfer time and spatial attention mechanisms that are not mediated by the corpus callosum. I30 THE NEURAL BASIS OF ATTENTIONAL TASK SET AND COGNITIVE CONTROL Kyle P. Tierney1, Preston P. Thakral1, Scott D. Slotnick1; 1Boston College — Cognitive control involves retrieval and maintenance of task set/rules. We hypothesized that neural activity associated with cognitive control would be revealed during a standard visual spatial attention paradigm (which requires changes in task set). During fMRI, participants were presented with two squares rotated 30° in polar angle from horizontal with the nearest corners 2° of visual angle from fixation and an edge length 4° in visual angle. Within each square, 320 dots (each 0.05° in width) moved 5° of visual angle per second and had 70% coherence. Participants had been trained to shift and then sustain attention to the dots within either the left or right visual field based on an auditory cue that occurred every 14 seconds. Their behavioral task was to detect a brief change in dot speed that occurred at uncertain times within the attended square, encouraging sustained attention at that location. This design yielded four main types of cognitive events/task sets: shift attention to the left (shift-left), shift attention to the right (shift-right), sustained attention to the left (sustained-left), and sustained attention to the right (sustained-right). Our preliminary analysis suggests that attentional shift task sets (shift-left > shift-right, shift-right > shift-left) were associated with differential activity in the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and temporal cortex. Sustained attention task sets (sustained-left > sustained-right, sustained-right > sustained-left) were associated with differential activity in the prefrontal cortex and the intraparietal sulcus. The prefrontal cortex association with attentional task set supports previous findings linking this region to cognitive control. I31 INCREASED INTRA-INDIVIDUAL REACTION TIME VARIABILITY IN ADHD ACROSS RESPONSE INHIBITION TASKS WITH DIFFERENT COGNITIVE DEMANDS Rebecca G. Vaurio1,2, Daniel J. Simmonds1, E. Mark Mahone1,2, Martha B. Denckla1,2, Stewart H. Mostofsky2,3; 1Kennedy Krieger Institute, 2Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine — One of the most consistent findings in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is increased moment-tomoment variability in reaction time (RT). In a recent study, the source of increased RT variability was examined using ex-Gaussian analyses of reaction time series that divide variability into normal (“sigma”) and exponential (“tau”) components. That study, however, reported performance on a choice RT task; it is unknown whether similar findings would be observed during tasks involving response inhibition. The objective of the present study was to examine these components of variability using both a “simple” Go/No-go task and a more “complex” Go/No-go task with increased working memory load. Participants were 108 children (ADHD, N=41; Control, N=67) ages 8-13 (mean=11.1). Two methods were used to measure variability: intra-individual coefficient of variability (ICV), calculated as (standard deviation of RT/mean RT) and exGaussian functions (sigma and tau). Repeated measures ANOVA showed main effects of diagnosis and task for ICV, with ICV being greater in the ADHD group (F=10.1, p=.002) and greater for the complex task (F=22.4, p<.001), with no diagnosis-by-task interaction. Similar findings were observed using ex-Gaussian analyses, with stronger effects for tau (greater sigma (F=3.2, p=.075) and tau (F=11.3, p=.001) in ADHD; greater sigma (F=4.6, p=.034) and tau (F=18.7, p<.001) in the complex task; and no diagnosis-by-task interaction). The results reveal increased RT variability in ADHD regardless of task complexity. The stronger tau effects suggest that increased variability is principally due to occasional slow responses reflecting lapses in behavioral control.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  271  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I32 ELECTRICAL SOURCE ANALYSIS OF DENSE ARRAY (256CHANNEL) EEG RECORDINGS OF SPIKE-WAVE SEIZURES REVEALS MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN VOLUNTARY CONTROL OF CONSCIOUS ATTENTION Allison C. Waters1, Don M. Tucker1,2, Phan Luu1,2, Mark Holmes2; 1University of Oregon, 2Electrical Geodesics, Inc. — The current study has two objectives: 1) to elucidate the neural source of spike-wave discharges associated with a temporary loss of conscious attention; and 2) to contrast results gained through the application of high-density (256 channel) EEG recording to results gained through the use of conventional (19 channel) EEG recording. The neural substrate of conscious attention involves thalamic control of widespread cortical networks. Absence spells are characterized by a momentary loss of voluntary control of attention, during which the person is inactive and unresponsive. In this study, the neural sources of spike-wave discharges associated with absence spells are elucidated using advanced methods of electrical source analysis. This reconstruction of dynamic activity in the brain is made possible by improved sampling of electrical potentials, volume-conducted to the face and neck in the 256-channel array, as well as accurate characterization of head tissue conductivity. Source analysis indicates that absence spells are associated with pathology in a circuit comprising ventro-medial frontal cortex, rostral thalamic reticular nucleus, and limbic nuclei of the thalamus. These findings are then contrasted with those obtained through conventional EEG (19 channels of the International Ten Twenty system) recording and analysis. Advanced methods of neural source analysis provide superior ability to resolve neural mechanisms that are disrupted in absence and appear to regulate important aspects of the voluntary control of conscious attention. I33 DOES AFFECTIVE PRIMING INFLUENCE ATTENTION PROCESSING IN SOCIALLY-ANXIOUS INDIVIDUALS? Lauren White1, Sarah Helfinstein1, Yair Bar-Haim2, Nathan Fox1; 1University of Maryland, 2Tel Aviv University — Anxious individuals show an attention bias towards threatening information. However, under conditions of sustained environmental threat this otherwise-present attention bias disappears. It remains unclear whether this suppression of attention bias is due to increased task effort under threat, or a shift in processing priorities. Further, it is unknown whether this suppression of attention bias can be caused by a transient activation of the fear system. In the present experiment, high socially-anxious and low socially-anxious individuals (HSA group, n = 12; LSA group, n = 12) performed a modified dot-probe task in which they were shown either a neutral or socially threatening prime word prior to each trial. EEG was collected and ERP components to the prime and face displays were computed. ERP results suggested differential processing of the faces display by HSA and LSA individuals. The behavioral results indicated that HSA individuals show an attention bias to threat after a neutral prime, but no attention bias after a threatening prime, demonstrating that suppression of attention bias can occur after a transient activation of the fear system. Reaction time data indicated that suppression of attention bias is not due to an increase in task effort. I34 MULTISENSORY CONFLICT MODULATES THE SPREAD OF VISUAL ATTENTION ACROSS A MULTISENSORY OBJECT Ulrike Zimmer1, Kenneth Roberts1, Marty Woldorff1; 1Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Duke University — Spatial attention to a visual stimulus paired with a task-irrelevant sound occurring synchronously from a different location can lead to increased activity not only in visual cortex, but also auditory cortex, apparently reflecting the object-related spreading of attention across both space and modality (Busse et al., PNAS, 2005). The processing of stimulus conflict, including multisensory stimulus conflict, is known to activate the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but the resultant influence on the sensory cortices remains relatively unexamined. Here, we asked whether the multisensory spread of visual attention across the sensory cortices previously observed will be modulated by whether there  272  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  is conceptual or object-related conflict between the relevant visual and irrelevant auditory inputs. In an fMRI-study, we presented matching and non-matching letter-sound combinations while subjects visually attended one of two lateralized visual letter-streams and ignored the synchronously occurring task-irrelevant central sounds. Spreading of visual attention across modalities was again observed, replicating our previous study. In addition, significant enhancements for incongruent versus congruent letter-sound combinations were observed in the ACC and in the contralateral visual cortex when the visual component was attended, presumably reflecting the need for boosted attention to the visual stimulus during incongruent trials. Moreover, activity in the auditory cortices also varied as a function of whether the spatially discordant auditory stimulation was incongruent versus congruent. Thus, conflict processing modulates the spreading of visual attention across a multisensory object at both the levels of the ACC and the sensory cortices.  Attentional processes: Visual I35 AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL ACCOUNT OF ATTENTIONAL ENHANCEMENT DUE TO ACTION AFFORDANCE Maha Adamo1, Nevena Simic1, Susanne Ferber1; 1University of Toronto — When an observer must detect two targets that occur in rapid succession, identification of the second target (T2) is impaired if it appears within roughly 500 ms of the first target (T1). This phenomenon, known as the attentional blink (AB), may be attributed to a failure of conscious report rather than of perceptual processing. We have previously demonstrated that providing an action association between the two targets will enhance detection of T2 such that the blink is diminished. In this study, we recorded EEG while administering a rapid serial visual presentation task. Targets, presented in pale green, were embedded among greyscale images of common objects. T1 was always a tool, and T2 was either an object that could be acted upon by that tool (ACT trials) or an unrelated object (NON trials). We tested three lags (200, 400, and 700 ms) in order to sample behavioural and neural responses at different phases of the blink. ACT trials elicited a smaller blink relative to NON trials, with greater T2 detection at the critical 200 ms lag. Furthermore, we observed sustained posterior activity in the ERP waveforms for detected relative to missed T2s, which was affected by both lag and condition. The enhancement in sustained activity found over posterior scalp sites for ACT T2s is particularly interesting given that tools are selectively represented in posterior inferior parietal cortices. Our ERP results may explain why action associations improve the probability of conscious report under demanding attentional conditions, such as during the AB. I36 INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY MODULATE THE EFFECTS OF WORKING MEMORY LOAD ON VISUAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION. Lubna Ahmed1, Jan de Fockert1; 1 Goldsmiths, University of London — Previous work has shown that both high working memory (WM) load (Lavie et al., 2004) and low working memory capacity (WMC; Kane & Engle, 2001) hinder the efficiency of selective attention, presumably because both represent situations in which resources needed for efficient selective attention become limited. Although the impact of these two factors on selective attention has been studied separately, it remains unknown how WM load and capacity interact to affect selective attention. The current studies investigated the interactive effects of WM load and capacity on distractor interference in Flanker and Navon tasks. Increasing load led to the predicted increase in distractor interference in high capacity individuals whereas for low capacity individuals the interference levels were equivalently high during both low and high WM load conditions. Under low load interference effects were greater for low capacity individuals compared to high, in other words distractor rejection of low capacity individuals under low  \\x0cPoster Session I  load were comparable to that of high capacity individuals under high load. This enhanced efficiency of selective attention seen in high WMC individuals under low Load presumably occurs because WM resources are available for the high but not the low WMC group. High WMC individuals increased distractor effects under high WM Load also indicates a reduction in these resources consequently leads to reduced efficiency of selective attention processes. These studies, utilising individual differences in WM as well as load manipulations, provide further support for the view that WM resources are required for the efficiency of selective attention. I37 NEURAL CORRELATES OF CATEGORY-INVARIANT ATTENTIONAL INHIBITION PRODUCED BY REJECTED VISUAL DISTRACTORS JeeWon Ahn1, Brian Levinthal1, Alejandro Lleras1, Diane Beck1; 1University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign — In an oddball visual search task, when participants view a target-absent display in which all items share a unique visual feature, if on a subsequent trial, the target shares that “rejected” feature, reaction times are slowed down by as much as 80 ms as compared to RTs to trials in which the target does not have the recently rejected feature. This phenomenon is known as the “Distractor Previewing Effect” and is thought to reflect the inhibition of attention to the previously “rejected” feature. Here we extend this effect to a category-oddball search task and show that this attentional inhibitory effect generalizes to complex visual categories, such that attentional allocation to any-and-all members of a recently rejected category is inhibited: our results show that focusing attention on an oddball “face” target is delayed by as much as 96 ms if “faces” had been rejected as distractors on the previous trial (compared to trials on which “houses” had been the previous distractors). Similarly, RTs to oddball “house” targets were delayed by 69 ms when “houses” had been recently rejected as distractors. This attentional inhibition is observed even though specific faces and houses where never repeated in the experiment, suggesting generalized category-wide inhibition. Using fMRI, we looked at activity in the human brain while participants performed this category-oddball task. Specifically, we examined activity in FFA and PPA, as well as fronto-parietal regions typically associated with attentional allocation and control. I38 EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON PERFORMING A SECONDARY TASK WHILE DRIVING Allyssa J. Allen1, Shashwath A. Meda1, Godfrey D. Pearlson1,2, Robert S. Astur1,2, Vince D. Calhoun1,2,3, Pawel Skudlarski1,2, Kathryn C. Ruopp1; 1Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center, Institute of Living at Hartford Hospital, Hartford, 2Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, 3The MIND Research Network, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque — Introduction: In a recent analysis of traffic accidents, alcohol exacerbated the negative effects of performing a secondary task while driving (Brewer 1980). Previous studies of visual oddball (VO) tasks report dose-dependent increases in reaction time (RT) (but no effect in correct hits or errors) with increased alcohol dose. We expect to replicate findings and to find associated decreased performance on a simulated driving task. Methods/Subjects: Forty male (N=20) and female healthy social drinkers (24.75 years + 4.7 years) were given three different doses of alcohol tailored to their gender and weight: placebo, moderate (BAC=0.05), and high (BAC=0.1). The subjects performed a VO task as part of a simulated driving paradigm, while being scanned in a 3T fMRI scanner. Results: Behavioral analysis with repeated measures ANOVA showed a dose-dependent linear increase in RT, with no effects in either correct hits or false alarms. In all conditions, driving speed decreased significantly after VO. However, in the high dose this decrease was significantly less. Passenger-side line crossings significantly increased. Functional analysis was done in SPM2 with repeated measures ANOVA showed dose-dependent linear decrease in BOLD activation of the hippocampus, anterior cingulate, and the dorsolateral prefrontal areas, with the least activation occurring during the high dose. Conclusions: These results suggest that driving impairment during secondary task perfor-  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  mance may be associated with impairment in the above brain regions, which are involved with attentional processes/decision-making. Drivers with high BAC’s may be less able to orient or detect a novel or sudden stimulus during driving. I39 A CONTINUOUS ATTENTION TRACKING TASK FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATTENTION PROCESSES IN ADHD AND NON-ADHD SUBJECTS Lourdes Anllo-Vento1, 1 1,2 Benjamin N. Cipollini , Vladimir López-Hernández , David L. Woods3; 1 University of California, San Diego, 2Diego Portales University, Santiago, Chile, 3University of California at Davis — Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) have proven useful in the assessment of attention impairments associated with developmental disorders. However, attention is a complex concept comprising multiple cognitive operations. And yet, current computer-based CPTs have a limited capability of detecting and profiling such processes. Here we present a newly developed Continuous Attention Tracking Task (CATT) that quantifies more than 30 measures of attention in an immersive 3D video-game environment with sub-second temporal resolution. Participants were 12 ADHD and 12 non-ADHD adults. Continuous EEG was recorded from 62 scalp sites while subjects engaged in the CATT in 4 blocks of 5 min each. We recorded responses to targets and non-targets, tracking accuracy, and latency of stop-signal responses at 60 Hz, as well as event-related potentials at 500 Hz. While overall tracking accuracy was comparable for ADHD and non-ADHD subjects, inhibition of tracking during a stop-signal was greater in control than ADHD subjects. Similarly, the non-ADHD group stopped tracking faster, and responded to targets faster and more accurately than ADHD subjects. Event-related potentials evoked by the target and non-target signals showed that the brain activity of non-ADHD subjects was selectively modulated starting at about 180 ms following stimulus onset. The CATT replicates prior CPT and Stop-Signal Task results in a more ecologically valid experimental setup that could be used in a clinical setting. As we extend our analyses to utilize the numerous behavioral and physiological measures provided by CATT, we hope to further characterize the patterns of attentional impairment associated with distinct developmental disorders. I40 SSVEP-BASED SINGLE-TRIAL CLASSIFICATION OF ATTENTION Andre Bastos1, Tim Mullen1, Ryan Canolty1, Brian Pasley1, Ralph Freeman1, Robert Knight1; 1Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, UC Berkeley — A real-time, continuous measure of attention could prove useful for several applications, including attention monitoring and training. Previous studies have shown that attention modulates the amplitude of the Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP), suggesting it could be used as a real-time measure of attention. We simultaneously presented two flickering stimuli to the left and right of central fixation. The stimuli were high-contrast circular gratings oscillating at 12.5 and 16.7 Hz. In response to a random cue, participants covertly attended to one stimulus while simultaneously ignoring the other. Stimuli were presented for 4.8 seconds, with a 5 second rest between trials. Analysis of 64-channel EEG collected throughout the task confirmed that attending to a particular hemifield produces a systematic change in the amplitude of the SSVEP. Narrow-band spectral estimation combined with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) allowed for robust single-trial classification of the attended hemifield with accuracies comparable to the highest reported in the literature. Based on these preliminary results, we suggest that the SSVEP amplitude could be used as a feedback signal for attention training. I41 PREDICTIVE GAZE-CUES INFLUENCE FACE PERCEPTION: THE EFFECT OF EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION Andrew Bayliss1, Steven Tipper1; 1Bangor University, UK — When we observe someone suddenly shift their gaze, we automatically shift our own attention to the same location. This ‘joint attention’ behaviour is very important for success-  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  273  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  fully engaging in social interactions. In adapted Posner cueing paradigms, faces are presented in the centre of the screen, which look to the left or right. Despite these gaze-cues being uninformative about the location of the target, participants are reliably faster to respond to targets that appear where the eyes look, as compared with targets that appear elsewhere. This study used two sets of faces in a gaze-cueing paradigm. Ten faces always correctly cued the target location (‘pro-predictive’), while ten faces never looked at the target location (‘anti-predictive’). After the cueing procedure, a series of 2AFC tasks showed that overall, ‘pro-predictive’ faces were evaluated as more trustworthy than ‘anti-predictive’ faces. Further, ‘anti-predictive’ faces appeared to be better encoded in memory. Nevertheless, after full debrief, participants were unable to correctly choose the ‘pro-predictive’ faces from each pair, suggesting they could not explicitly recall which faces had looked at the target. However, these effects were only significant where each face had a happy expression. Faces with neutral and angry expressions did not reliably elicit these effects of gaze-cueing on face processing. This suggests that a positive facial expression is necessary for these gaze-cueing contingencies to affect the evaluation of, and memory for faces in a joint attention episode. I42 SPATIAL ATTENTIONAL (RE)ORIENTING IN ADHD AND NONADHD CHILDREN: ASSOCIATION WITH DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER (DAT1) GENE VARIANTS. Mark Bellgrove1, Katherine Johnson2, Edwina Barry3, Ziarih Hawi3, Michael Gill3, Ian Robertson2, Christopher Chambers4; 1School of Psychology and Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland, Australia, 2School of Psychology and Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, 3School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, 4Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, UK — Impairments of spatial selective attention in children with ADHD remain controversial. This study examined whether individual differences in the spatial attention of 101 children with and without ADHD could be explained by allelic variation in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). DAT is the primary site of action of stimulants used to treat ADHD and a number of DNA variants within this gene appear to confer risk to ADHD. Importantly, anomalies of spatial attention in ADHD have been reported to be improved by stimulants, suggesting a role for DAT1 in spatially selective deficits in ADHD. All children performed a reflexive covert visual orienting paradigm in which attention was cued validly, invalidly or un-informatively with respect to the hemifield of an upcoming target. Children with ADHD had a higher frequency of “high-risk” genotypes (homozygosity for the 10repeat DAT1 VNTR) than control children. In addition, irrespective of diagnostic status, children who were homozygous for the 10-repeat allele had higher ADHD symptomatology. ADHD children who carried the high-risk DAT1 genotype displayed a number of attentional anomalies relative to both ADHD children without the risk genotype and genotyped control children. At short stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs) ADHD children with the high-risk DAT1 genotype were slow to reorient attention on invalidly cued trials, particularly when targets appeared in the left hemifield. At longer SOAs children with ADHD were slower to reorient attention from invalid cues and this effect was also influenced by DAT1 genotype. Results are discussed in terms of the role of dopamine in spatial attention. I43 EFFECTS OF PRISM ADAPTATION ON APPROACH AND WITHDRAWAL Janet Bultitude1, Robert Rafal1; 1School of Psychology, University of Wales, Bangor — Prism adaptation can ameliorate hemispatial neglect symptoms and induce neglect-like performance in healthy participants. Two studies examined whether adaptation to 15º leftward shifts in healthy participants can induce a non-lateralized motor-intentional bias associated with neglect: the tendency to make faster withdrawal than approach responses. In Experiment 1 participants moved a lever forwards (approach) or backwards (withdrawal) in response to  274  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  arrows displayed on a computer screen. Faster withdrawal responses were observed following adaptation to leftward shifting prisms, while RTs for approach responses were unchanged. These results suggest that prism adaptation may not only improve the spatially lateralized bias of neglect, but also improve associated non-lateralized deficits. Experiment 2 sought to further illuminate the motor-intentional vs emotional-motivational nature of the induced withdrawal bias by requiring participants to perform the same actions under conditions of participant-centred vs screen-centred instructions. It was predicted that a motor-intentional withdrawal bias would result in reduced post-adaptation RTs for backwards movements regardless of the frame of reference, whereas an emotional-motivational withdrawal bias would result in reduced RTs for movement which caused the lever to be distanced from the object of reference. I44 TEMPORALLY SELECTIVE ATTENTION MODULATES EARLY PERCEPTUAL PROCESSING OF IMAGES PRESENTED IN RAPIDLY CHANGING STREAMS William Bush1, Lisa D. Sanders1; 1 University of Massachusetts, Amherst — Spatially selective attention allows viewers to preferentially process the most relevant information in complex scenes. Temporally selective attention has been shown to enhance processing of information presented at specific times. Temporal selection is hypothesized to be particularly crucial when stimuli change rapidly since under these conditions it is not possible to process all of the information in detail. However, most ERP studies showing effects of temporally selective attention on early perceptual processing have not included rapidly changing information. The current study examined the effects of temporal attention on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). On each block of trials, participants were directed to attend to one of three times after a brief tone: short (500 ms), middle (1000 ms) or long (1500 ms). They were asked to press a button as quickly as possible if a deviant (digit) appeared at the attended time only in a stream of letters. VEPs were measured in response to task irrelevant probes presented at the critical times. Temporally selective attention modulated early visual components such that mean amplitude was larger in response to probes presented at attended times. The latency and distribution of these affects were compared with what has typically been reported for spatially selective attention. Additionally, a contingent negative variation (CNV) was observed around the attended time. These results demonstrate that temporally selective attention can be used to preferentially process information presented at critical times within rapidly changing visual displays. I45 SEPARATING THE EFFECTS OF INTERMODAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION, AUDITORY DISTRACTION AND STIMULUS TYPE ON VISUAL FMRI ACTIVATIONS Anthony D. Cate1, Timothy J. Herron1, Xiaojiang Kang1,2, E. William Yund1, David L. Woods1,2,3; 1Human Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab, VA Research Service, Martinez, CA, 2Center for Neuroscience, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, 3UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain, Davis — Cortical surface mapping was used to distinguish the effects of intermodal selective attention, auditory distraction, visual stimulus type and their interactions on whole-brain fMRI visual activations. Nine subjects each completed 6 hour-long sessions employing both continuous (2.9s TR) and sparse image acquisition (10.4s TR), which reduced activations due to scanner acoustic noise. Subjects performed demanding one-back tasks with either visual (faces or words) or auditory (tone triplets) stimuli in a blocked factorial design that included four key conditions. In “bimodal visual” blocks subjects performed a visual task while ignoring auditory stimuli; in “unimodal visual” blocks no auditory distracters were present. Equivalent bimodal and unimodal auditory blocks were also included. Visual and auditory stimuli had randomly staggered onsets to reduce crossmodal integration effects. Subjects’ cortical hemispheres were segmented to isolate gray matter, inflated to a sphere and aligned to a common coordinate system  \\x0cPoster Session I  for group analysis using FreeSurfer. A bimodal visual vs. bimodal auditory contrast showed the effects of task modality-selective attention separate from stimulus-specific effects, since both conditions contained identical stimuli. These visual attention-related modulations (ARMs) comprised a specific subset of the stimulus-dependent activations present in occipitotemporal (OT) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) regions. Additional contrasts isolated anterior visual ARM areas that were significantly more active when auditory stimuli were present. Interactions between the attentional and stimulus type factors of the design further specified well-defined subregions involved during face and word tasks, not only in OT but also in IPS. These results clarify how attention modulates neural responses to visual stimuli. I46 INFLUENCE OF PREFRONTAL-VISUAL ASSOCIATIVE CORTICAL NETWORKS IN A SELECTIVE-ATTENTION, WORKING-MEMORY PARADIGM James Chadick1, Aaron Rutman1, Adam Gazzaley1,2; 1University of California, San Francisco, 2Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley — Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been shown to modulate activity in the visual association cortex (VAC) in a goal-directed fashion. As older adults show a deficit in attention-driven modulation of VAC, the PFC-VAC network is a prime target for studying the neural basis of age-related cognitive decline. Previous studies in our lab have focused on a selective-attention working memory paradigm where relevant and irrelevant stimuli were presented sequentially. A more real world based approach would be to study modulation associated with simultaneously presented stimuli, when a subject is required to concurrently enhance and suppress competing visual information. To explore this, we employed a selective-attention working memory task in healthy, young adults (22-35 years old) in both an fMRI and EEG experiment. Subjects were presented with simultaneously overlapping stimuli consisting of faces and scenes and were instructed to remember either faces or scenes, or to passively view the stimuli. After a brief delay, a probe stimulus was presented and the subject’s responded if the probe matched either relevant stimuli. We found significant modulation of BOLD signal in posterior stimulus-selective VAC regions based on task instruction, which corresponded with early modulation (~100 msec) of posterior EEG waveforms. Preliminary multivariate analysis indicates this modulation is associated with a PFC-VAC network. Currently, we are investigating the effects of aging on these networks with the hypothesis that aging-related changes in VAC modulation may be due to loss of fidelity of PFC-VAC connectivity. I47 NEURAL BASES OF GOAL-DIRECTED SELECTION OF INFORMATION FOR WORKING MEMORY Anthony J.-W. Chen1,2,3, Terry Nycum3, Michael Britton2,3, Mark D\\'Esposito1,2,3; 1VA Medical Center, 2 University of California, San Francisco, 3University of California, Berkeley — Topdown selection of information for more in-depth processing in working memory is a crucial step for efficient and effective goal-directed behavior. On the other hand, selectivity of processing for particular features of information appears to be an intrinsic property of ascending levels of visual cortical processing. We hypothesize that modulation of this intrinsic selectivity is a mechanism for goal-directed modulation of information processing. We present an fMRI task that involves presentation of serial image stimuli (two categories, faces and scenes, pseudo-randomly inter-leaved), with demands for top-down selection of a subset for working memory processing, making the other images distractors in a category-selective n-back task. The design allows calculations of the relative category-selectivity of activity in pre-defined regions of interest. We calculate (10 subjects) intrinsic category selectivity for regions of visual association cortex during baseline tasks requiring minimal selection (either simply viewing and categorizing all images, or trying to hold in mind all images), and results are congruent with an independent task with blocked faces and scenes. We then show that selectivity in these regions is modulated by goal-directed selection demands, such that selectivity for goal-relevant stimuli is increased, while selectivity for non-relevant stim-  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  uli is decreased. Regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex show strong goaldirected stimulus-selectivity when tasks demand selection. These prefrontal regions may thus be a source of the top-down signals that bias the selectivity of the posterior regions. These fMRI measurements should be useful for examining how selection processes are affected by brain injuries and neurological interventions. I48 ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN CORTICAL ACTIVATION DURING TASK-SWITCHING Matthew Costello1, David Madden1, Julia Spaniol2, Nancy Denis3, Barbara Bucur4, Roberto Cabeza3, James Provenzale1, Scott Huettel1; 1Duke University Medical Center, 2Ryerson University, 3Duke University, 4University of Missouri, St. Louis — Older adults have shown increased top-down involvement in attentional tasks, suggesting a greater role of frontal activity within a frontoparietal network. To explore this possibility, we tested 18 younger (18-27 years; 9 female) and 16 older (60-85 years; 9 female) adults in a 3T fMRI experiment that assessed transient cortical activation associated with task switching. On cue-plus-target trials, a visual cue indicated which one of two category judgments was to be made on the upcoming target word: manmade/natural or large/small. On cue-only trials, the cue was presented without an accompanying target. Each trial was coded as a task switch or repeat, relative to the previous trial. Cue-related activity for both age groups was located in occipital and frontal regions bilaterally, with additional left posterior parietal activations for older adults. Target-related activity for younger adults elicited broad occipital-parietal-frontal activations that were primarily left lateralized. Younger adults’ target-related activity was greater for repeats than for switches. For older adults, target processing elicited a similar network but maintained largely bilateral activity, with right parietal activation for switch trials. Functional connectivity analyses indicated that, for cue-related activity, older adults exhibited correlated activation within occipital regions, whereas younger adults exhibited greater bilateral frontal connectivity. For target related activity, older adults showed widespread connectivity within the frontoparietal network, whereas for younger adults correlated activations were primarily in occipital regions. The results suggest that, during task switching, younger adults activate an attention-dependent frontoparietal network during cue processing, whereas older adults activate this network later, during target processing. I49 MODULATION OF P1 AS A FUNCTION OF VISUAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN Jane Couperus1; 1Hampshire College — Research suggests that children, like adults, show modulation of early brain processes as a function of selective attention (Bartgis, Lilly, & Thomas, 2003, Maatta, Paakkinen, Saavalaninen & Partanen, 2005, Perez-Edgar &Fox, 2005, Sanders, Stevens, Coch, & Neville, 2006, Taylor & Khan, 2000). However, while studies involving auditory attention have shown modulations in the amplitude of the P1 event related potential (ERP) component as a function of selective attention (e.g. Sanders et al., 2006), only changes in latency of early components have been demonstrated with visual stimuli (Taylor and Khan, 2000). The present investigation first replicates adult studies of visual selective attention (e.g. Mangun & Hillyard, 1991) showing selective attention based modulation of the P1 and then extends this research to children ages 7-10. Children and adults were presented with pictures at both fixation and in their peripheral visual field above fixation. In one task they were asked to attend to only the pictures appearing at fixation and determine whether the picture was an animal or vehicle. In a second task they were asked to maintain fixation but also report on pictures not presented at fixation. In both children and adults, P1 amplitude to pictures presented above fixation were significantly increased when the target stimulus was attended (task at both fixation and above fixation) as compared to unattended (task only at fixation) (adults: F(1,5)=15.23, p=.011, children: F(1,6)=9.50, p=.022). These results show that stimulus processing in children, like adults, is modulated by selective attention early in visual processing.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  275  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I50 MOTOR PLANS INFLUENCE THE VISUAL PROCESSING OF OBSERVED ACTIONS Ross Cunnington1, Cassandra Biddick1, Jason B Mattingley1; 1Queensland Brain Institute and School of Psychology, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia — The perception and the execution of action appear to be linked by common neural mechanisms. Observed actions lead to increased activity in motor and premotor cortical areas and can interfere with the execution of opposite or incongruent actions. The “mirror” system has been suggested to mediate this link, directly matching observed actions onto equivalent motor representations in the motor system. While many studies have focussed on the influence of observed actions on the motor system, it is not known whether motor plans can similarly influence earlier visual processing associated with the perception of actions in a top-down manner. We tested this hypothesis specifically by examining visual evoked potentials (64-channel EEG) to images of hand gesture actions that were either congruent or incongruent with hand actions concurrently planned by participants in a Go-NoGo paradigm. The visual processing of observed actions was found to be significantly influenced by concurrent motor plans. Specifically, the N170 component of visual evoked potentials, known to be associated with the processing of biological stimuli, was significantly enhanced when observed actions were incongruent with concurrently planned actiona. Crucially, this effect was specific to the congruency of motor plans, and was not observed in a control condition involving similar stimulus incongruency but without motor planning. Our results provide further evidence for the association between the perception and execution of action, perhaps mediated by a mirror neuron system. Specifically, we have shown that motor plans or representations in the motor system can influence the visual processing of observed actions.  Emotion I51 EMOTION-COGNITION INTERACTION: WORKING MEMORY AND TRANSIENT EMOTIONAL INTERFERENCE Alan Anticevic1, Grega Repovs1, Jennifer Staplins1, Tara Benesch1, Todd Braver1, Deanna Barch1; 1Washington University in St. Louis — Humans possess a unique ability to sustain goal-directed attention for extended periods of time regardless of incoming distractions. One example is maintenance and manipulation of information in working memory (WM), which involves a constellation of brain areas including the dorsal-parietal network. However, there are times when it is critical for humans to rapidly disengage internally focused attention and attend to relevant environmental stimuli, including those that might be task-irrelevant but survival relevant. Previous work has shown that a functional region at or near the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is a part of a system involved in detecting task-relevant information. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that TPJ acts as a possible ‘circuit-breaker’ of the sustained, goal-directed system when reallocation of attention is warranted. However, previous investigations have not addressed the question if TPJ plays a part in helping reorient attention when emotionally salient, but task irrelevant information is presented. We used event-related functional neuroimaging at 3T to examine whether TPJ is responsive to task-irrelevant emotionally salient distraction. Furthermore, we investigated whether TPJ responsiveness across different distracter types (i.e. emotional and task-relevant) was moderated as a function of WM load. The results suggest that TPJ’s role in integrating attentional and cognitive processes might also extend to emotional processing, and that the role of TPJ as a “circuit-breaker” varies as a function of memory load. Furthermore, these studies will shed light on the mechanisms that govern the interaction between goalfocused processes and allocation of attention to emotionally salient events in the environment.  276  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  I52 ROLE OF ALPHA-1 NOREPINEPHRINE RECEPTORS IN MDMA (ECSTASY) EFFECTS: A CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL Matthew Baggott1,3, Gantt Galloway1, Margie Jang1, Ryne Didier2, John Mendelson1; 1Cal Pac Medical Center Research Institute, San Francisco, 2 Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine, Portland, 3Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley — BACKGROUND/AIMS: Preclinical data suggests psychostimulant effects are mediated by multiple neurotransmitter mechanisms including noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic. MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, \\'Ecstasy\\') is an illicitly used drug with some typical psychostimulant effects (e.g., increased heart rate, blood pressure and positive mood) and some putatively atypical social and emotional (so-called ‘entactogen’) effects (e.g., increased self-report sociability). To examine possible noradrenergic mechanisms of MDMA, we administered MDMA alone and in combination with the alpha-1 noradrenergic inverse agonist prazosin. We hypothesized alpha-1 receptors contribute to the typical psychostimulant but not putatively atypical effects of MDMA. METHODS: 16 healthy MDMA-experienced participants (8 males and 8 females) received placebo, 1.5 mg/kg PO MDMA, 1-2 mg PO prazosin, or both drugs in a four-session balanced controlled trial in a laboratory setting. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (physiological, neurocognitive, and self-report) measures were made and analyzed using linear mixed-effects models in R. RESULTS: MDMA alone increased measures of both typical psychostimulant (heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, positive mood) and putatively atypical effects (sociability). Prazosin alone did not significantly affect these measures. As hypothesized, co-administration of prazosin significantly modified MDMA effects on typical psychostimulant but not putatively atypical measures. CONCLUSIONS: Alpha-1 noradrenergic mechanisms may contribute to some typical psychostimulant but not to putatively atypical effects of MDMA. Although statistically significant, the influence of prazosin on MDMA effects was modest, suggesting a role for other receptors or neurotransmitters. Supported by NIH DA 016776. I53 MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM NOT BROKEN IN ADULTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER FOR VIEWING EMOTIONS OF OTHERS Jojanneke Bastiaansen1,2, Marc Thioux1, Christian Keysers1; 1Social Brain Lab, BCN Neuroimaging Center, University Medical Center Groningen, 2Lentis, Autism Team North Netherlands, Groningen — The mirror theory of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) proposes that ASD is characterized by reduced mirroring. For emotions, Dapretto et al. (2006) found that while children with ASD view the facial expressions of other individuals, they do not activate areas involved in producing their own facial expressions or experiencing their own emotions as much as typically developing (TD) individuals. To test this whether this holds for adults with ASD, we scanned 17 high functioning ASD adults and 17 matched TDs while they passively view movies of pleased, disgusted and neutral facial expressions. To our surprise individuals with ASD activated their ‘social brain’ not less but more strongly than TDs. In particular while viewing disgusted facial expressions, they show stronger activations in high level visual (fusiform gyrus), somatosensory (SI/SII), motor (M1), emotional (insula, amygdala) and mentalizing (mPFC, TPJ) areas as well as BA45 and posterior parietal cortex. This finding challenges the mirror theory of autism by showing that at least for movies of certain facial emotional expressions, the adult autistic brain appears to share motions and emotions even more strongly than the TD brain. This raises the possibility that individuals with ASD may find the social world challenging not because it fails to engage them but because it overwhelms them. Alternatively, the observed hyper-activation may indicate high functioning ASD adults cope with a less efficient brain by making it work harder, utilizing both reflective mentalizing (mPFC, TPJ) and simulation (SI/SII, insula, amygdalae) to obtain the social insights TDs take for granted.  \\x0cPoster Session I  I54 PERCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE USE OF MULTIPLE EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES Genna Bebko1,2, Steven 2 3 1,2 1 Franconeri , Kevin Ochsner , Joan Chiao ; Northwestern University Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, 2Northwestern University, 3 Columbia University — We constantly regulate the experience and expression of our emotions in order to maintain physical, psychological, and social well-being (Abelson, Liberzon, Young, Khan, 2005; Gross, 2002). Prior research has shown that multiple cognitive strategies are employed to regulate emotional responses to aversive events, a process which, at the neural level, reflects modulation of amygdala response by prefrontal regions (Ochsner & Gross, 2005). Given the modulation of amygdala activity not only by prefrontal regions but also by primary visual cortices (Vuilleumier & Driver, 2007), we hypothesized that attentional deployment may also vary depending on the type of emotion regulation strategy used. To test this possibility, eye movements were measured while healthy young adult participants viewed negative IAPS images and regulated emotions by using either reappraisal (N=15), an antecedent-focused emotion regulation strategy, or suppression (N=16), a response-focused emotion regulation strategy. Consistent with prior studies, participants reported lower negative valence ratings for pictures during emotion regulation compared to the attend condition. Additionally, participants in the reappraisal group showed lower negative valence ratings relative to those in the suppression group. Novel eye movement results show that all participants made fewer fixations during emotion regulation compared to the attend condition, particularly in a priori defined emotionally salient areas compared with the background. Critically, participants suppressing their emotions made fewer eye movements relative to participants reappraising their emotions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that reappraisal and suppression vary not only in behavioral outcome but also in how attention is deployed across emotionally-rich visual scenes during regulation. I55 NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF EMOTION REGULATION AMONG YOUNG ADULTS Cristina Benavides1, Christopher Beevers1, Natalie Dailey1, David Schnyer2 ; 1University of Texas at Austin, 2Imaging Research Center, University of Texas at Austin — Cognitive studies have indicated that a human serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) gene polymorphism is associated with biased processing of emotional information that likely results from altered functional connectivity within a corticolimbic circuit. The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an attentional cuing task utilizing emotional face stimuli to investigate the neural underpinnings of this biased emotional processing. While recording fMRI, 18 young adult females were exposed to a briefly presented picture of a face with a happy, sad or neutral expression that was lateralized to right or left screen positions. These faces were followed by a target of one or two asterisks presented either in the location of the picture (valid-cue, VC) or in the opposing screen position (Invalid-cue, IC). Participants were asked to indicate whether they saw one or two asterisks. Response times indicated a clear effect of cuing for emotional faces (happy and sad). In addition, clear neural differences were associated with VC and IC of sad facial expressions such that VC resulted in greater left amygdala activity while IC was resulted in greater left prefrontal activity. Participants were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR alleles and preliminary results from 7 subjects have indicated that allele status is predictive of responses in the amygdala and prefrontal regions such that greater prefrontal/less amygdala activity is associated with less vulnerability to biased emotional processing. Division of the larger sample will be carried out when genotyping is completed.  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I56 AGGRESSION CHANGES THE PROCESSING OF EMOTIONAL FACES - AN ERP STUDY Katja Bertsch1, Robina Khan1, Ewald Naumann1, Menno Kruk2, Michael Hermes1, Patrick Britz1; 1University of Trier, 2Leiden University — According to animal research on aggression, the perception and processing of social conflict stimuli might play an important role both in the elicitation and in the escalation of aggressive behavior. So far, the influence of experimentally induced aggressive behavior on information processing has barely been studied in humans. In an ERP study, we investigated the processing of emotional faces (happy, neutral, fearful and angry) in an emotional Stroop task after experimentally provoking aggressive behavior in half of our healthy participants with the Taylor Aggression Paradigm. Although participants of the experimental group showed similar reaction times than those of a non-provoked control group, significant group differences were found in the amplitude of three ERP components (P200, P300, slow wave). Only for the P200 amplitude, this group effect was also modulated by the emotion of the faces, showing largest effects for negative emotional stimuli in the experimental group. Furthermore, in the experimental group the P200 amplitude was positively correlated with aggressive behavior. These results indicate an association between aggression and a change in early, more automatic as well as in later, more controlled and conscious stages of information processing without resulting in any behavioral differences. I57 THE INFLUENCE OF ADVICE ON REWARD BASED DECISION MAKING AND LEARNING Guido Biele1,2, Lea Krugel1,2, Jörg Rieskamp1, Hauke Heekeren1,2; 1Max Planck Institute for Human Development, 2Berlin NeuroImaging Center, Charité University Medicine Berlin — When decision makers choose between alternatives, they can rely on their own experience with the alternatives and on advice. Here we investigate how prior advice influences learning between different alternatives by modeling the learning process and by describing the influence of advice on the neural representation of outcomes. 21 participants performed a modified version of the Iowa Gambling Task, after they received a recommendation indicating which deck they should choose. Behavioral results indicate a long-lasting influence of advice on decisions, which was reflected in participants’ preference of the recommended card deck over a corresponding deck with the same payoff distribution, even when advice was bad. Participants’ reliance on advice was modeled with a Reinforcement Learning model implementing the additional assumption that monetary outcomes from recommended alternatives are perceived to be more positive than the same outcome from a non-recommended alternative. The fMRI analysis showed that positive outcomes were associated with stronger bold responses in the ventral striatum and in the orbitofrontal cortex. Negative outcomes were associated with stronger activation in the anterior insula. Region of interest analyses showed that positive feedback after recommended choices led to stronger activation in the ventral striatum, compared to positive feedback after non- recommended choices. Negative feedback after recommended choices led to a weaker activation in the anterior insula. These results suggest that advice influences decision making and learning by directly changing the perception of outcomes, so that gains/losses from recommended choices are experienced as more positive/less negative than the same outcomes from non-recommended choices. I58 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU: THE NEURAL RESPONSE TO SOCIAL PRAISE AND CRITICISM IN GENERALIZED SOCIAL PHOBIA (GSP). Karina Blair1, Marilla Geraci1, Jeffrey DeVido1, Daniel McCaffrey1, Pamela Ng1, Nick Hollon1, Matthew Jones1, James Blair1, Daniel Pine1; 1National Institute of Mental Health — Background: Generalized social phobia (GSP) is characterized by fear/ avoidance of social situations. Previous studies have examined the neural responses of patients with GSP to one class of social stimuli, facial expressions. However, stud-  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  277  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  ies have not examined the neural response in GSP to another, equally important class of social stimuli, the communication of praise or criticism. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the authors examined the neural response to receipt of praise or criticism in GSP. Method: Seventeen unmedicated patients with GSP and seventeen age, IQ, and gender matched healthy comparison individuals read positive (e.g., You are beautiful), negative (e.g., You are ugly), and neutral (e.g. You are human) comments that could be either about the self, or about somebody else (e.g. He is beautiful). Results: Hypothesized significant group-by-valence-by-referent interactions were observed within regions of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral amygdala. In these regions, the patients with GSP showed significantly increased BOLD responses, relative to comparison individuals, to negative comments (criticism) referring to themselves. However, in contrast, there were no significant group differences with respect to neutral or positive comments referring to self or others, or negative comments referring to others. Conclusions: These results implicate the MPFC, involved in the representation of the self, together with the amygdala, in the pathophysiology of GSP. Further, findings demonstrate a powerful effect of psychological context on neural-circuitry hyperactivity in GSP, findings that may help guide novel therapeutics. I59 THE VALUED BRAIN: THE NEURAL REFERENCE SPACE FOR CORE AFFECT Eliza Bliss-Moreau1, Tor Wager2, Kristen Lindquist1, Hedy Kober2, Josh Josephs2, Matthew Davidson2, Lisa Feldman Barrett1,3; 1Boston College, 2Columbia University, 3Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School — The science of emotion has long been preoccupied with determining which states are biologically primitive—states thought to be neurologically hardwired, present at birth, and homologous across mammals. For decades, researchers have sought the distinct neural, physiological and behavioral patterns for discrete emotions such as “anger”, “sadness” and “fear”. While there is some evidence for this “basic emotion perspective” (for reviews see Izard, 2007; Panksepp, 2007), the majority of the evidence is consistent with the existence of a broader system of distributed neural networks supporting more general core affective states which are themselves necessary (but not sufficient) for any emotional event (for review, Barrett, Lindquist, Bliss-Moreau et al., 2007). Core affect is a biologically primitive affective state that results from translating sensory information into an internal, neurophysiological code which is experienced as pleasant or unpleasant (Barrett, 2006; Russell, 2003). In the present meta-analytic review, we used new meta-analytic techniques to identify the regions consistently activated across all neuroimaging studies of emotion published from 1995 to 2005 (N = 163). First, we identified a neural reference space for core affective processing (i.e., the processing of value) that relies on a distributed network of both cortical (e.g., oribtofrontal, medial prefrontal) and subcortical (e.g., amygdala, hypothalamus) structures. Second, we demonstrated that the neural instantiation of each discrete emotion category is highly overlapping within this neural reference space. Implications for the neural investigation of emotion and affect are discussed. I60 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING BY PUNISHMENT AND REWARD OMISSION: EVIDENCE FROM ERROR-RELATED EVENT RELATED POTENTIAL COMPONENTS. Maarten Boksem1, Mattie Tops2, Evelien Kostermans1, David De Cremer1; 1Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands, 2Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands — In a recent experiment (Boksem et al., 2006), we showed that error related Event Related Potential (ERP) components, such as the Error Related Negativity (ERN) and Error Positivity (Pe), were related to punishment and reward sensitivity. The present study was conducted to further evaluate the relationship between punishment/reward sensitivity and error related ERP components. Therefore, we scored our subjects on the Behavioral Inhibition – Behavioral Activation (BIS/BAS) measures of punishment and reward sensitivity. Then, subjects performed one of two versions of a  278  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  Flanker task: in one, they were financially punished for committing errors; in the other, they were financially rewarded for correct performance. Analyses of ERN amplitudes indicated significant interactions between personality measures of punishment (BIS) and reward (BAS) and actual punishment and reward, while analyses of Pe amplitudes showed a significant interactions between personality measures of reward and actual reward. We suggest that ERN/Ne amplitude is related to concerns over mistakes and depends on the level of aversion experienced by individual subjects when making these mistakes. Subjects that are highly sensitive to punishment are strongly motivated or engaged in avoiding punishment, while subjects sensitive to rewards are motivated to obtain rewards and therefore show high task engagement when rewards may be earned. The error related ERP components appears to track this level of engagement in task performance. I61 FAILURE TO REVISE DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES IN THE FACE OF CONTINGENCY SHIFTS: THE MODIFIED IOWA GAMBLING TASK AND SCHIZOTYPY Caroline Bowman1, Oliver 1 1 Turnbull ; School of Psychology, Bangor University, Gwynedd, Wales, UK — The need to adapt to a changing environment in which once rewarding strategies have become punishing is an essential ability quite often disrupted in people with schizophrenia. This study investigated whether individuals highly rated in schizotypy, although neurologically normal, had similar problems in modifying behaviour when faced with affective contingency shifts. Following the three-factor model of schizotypy, candidates scoring either above the 75th percentile or below the 50th percentile on each factor were selected from a database of 404 undergraduate participants who had previously completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ; overall mean 26.78). Sixteen participants formed the High Schizotypy group, while 20 participants comprised the Low Schizotypy group (overall mean 40.94 & 16.25, respectively). All participants completed the modified Iowa Gambling Task, which in addition to the original task included shifting phases in which deck contingencies reversed. Measures of subjective awareness, assessing whether participants had explicit knowledge about deck properties, were also collected. Additionally, skin conductance responses (SCR) were assessed to establish any differences in psychophysiological arousal. The results showed that the High Schizotypy group learned the advantageous decision-making strategy during the original task, but made significantly more disadvantageous choices during the shifting periods than did the Low Schizotypy group. Moreover, this occurred in spite of apparently normal SCRs and awareness ratings, indicating knowledge of the new contingencies. The finding that those rated highly in schizotypy are seemingly ‘ignoring’ crucial information from subjective awareness and physiological sources to the detriment of behavioural performance has important clinical and theoretical implications. I62 THE NEURAL MECHANISMS OF SPECIFIC PAVLOVIAN-TOINSTRUMENTAL TRANSFER EFFECTS IN HUMANS Signe Bray1, Bernard Balleine2, Shinsuke Shimojo3, Antonio Rangel4, John O\\'Doherty4; 1California Institute of Technology, Computation and Neural Systems, 2 University of California Los Angeles, 3California Institute of Technology, Division of Biology, 4California Institute of Technology, Division of Humanities and Social Sciences — There is considerable evidence that a cue established as predictive of a specific outcome will bias choice towards actions associated with that outcome. Formally referred to as specific Pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT), this effect has been argued to model the influence of reward-related cues in advertising and drug addiction. To assess the neural bases of this influence we scanned 23 healthy subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they underwent Pavlovian and instrumental training, followed by a transfer test. During the training phase, subjects learned to associate simple visual shape stimuli with one of four outcomes: orange juice, chocolate milk, cola and an affectively neutral tasteless control solution. The training session also  \\x0cPoster Session I  included instrumental training trials in which the subjects chose from a pair of four possible button push actions that earned distinct outcomes: two of the button push actions led to reward outcomes and two led to the neutral outcome. Next, specific transfer was assessed, in extinction, by presenting the Pavlovian cues and assessing the choice between pairs of actions. We found a significant specific transfer effect: when subjects chose between actions, they favored the action corresponding to the outcome predicted by the concurrently presented Pavlovian cue. Neuroimaging results showed a significant difference in BOLD responses in ventolateral putamen on trials when subjects chose the action compatible with the Pavlovian cue compared to the incompatible action. These results provide important insight into the neural processes that mediate the influence of stimulus-outcome associations on decision making in humans. I63 BEHOLD THE VOICE OF WRATH: EMOTIONAL PROSODY MODULATES EARLY STAGES OF VISUAL PROCESSING Tobias Brosch1,2, Didier Grandjean1,2, David Sander1,2, Klaus R. Scherer1,2; 1Swiss Centre for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva, Switzerland, 2University of Geneva, Switzerland — Emotional attention, the boosting of the neural representation of emotional stimuli, is usually investigated within a sensory modality, e.g. by using emotional pictures to modulate visual attention. In real-life environments, however, humans typically encounter simultaneous input to several different senses, such as vision and audition. As multiple signals entering different channels might originate from a common, emotionally relevant source, prioritization of emotional stimuli should be able to operate across modalities. Therefore, in this study we explored cross-modal emotional attention. Spatially localized utterances with emotional and neutral prosody served as cues for visually presented non-emotional targets in a cross-modal dot probe task. Participants were faster to respond to targets appearing at the spatial source of emotional compared to neutral prosody. Event-related brain potentials revealed emotional modulation of early visual target processing at the level of the P1 component. Neural sources in visual cortex were more active for targets appearing at the spatial location of emotional compared to neutral prosody. These effects were not found using synthesized control sounds matched for mean fundamental frequency and amplitude envelope, ruling out the possibility that these low-level acoustic parameters triggered the effect. Our results show for the first time that emotional attention can operate across sensory modalities by boosting early sensory stages of processing, thus facilitating the multimodal evaluation of emotionally relevant stimuli in the environment. Based on previous anatomical evidence, we suggest that the enhanced occipital activation for visual targets preceded by emotional voice cues is driven by connections between amygdala and sensory cortices. I64 COGNITIVE REGULATION OF EMOTION: A COMPARATIVE META-ANALYTIC APPROACH Jason Buhle1, Jared X. Van Snellenberg1, Edward E. Smith1, Tor D. Wager1; 1Columbia University — We performed a meta-analysis of 13 human neuroimaging studies of volitional emotion regulation in order to identify common activity across diverse stimuli, strategies and goals. Emotion regulation consistently increased activity in several \\'source\\' regions: left dorsal premotor area; left pre-supplementary motor area; bilateral inferior frontal gyrus; left dorsal anterior insula; and a dorsal medial junction (medial BA 6 and 8, dorsal BA 32) region (DMJ; commonly referred to as anterior cingulate cortex). The only ‘target’ region consistently modulated by regulation was the left amygdala. To interpret these findings we compared them to results of previous meta-analyses of emotion and cognition, including working memory, long term memory, inhibition, and task switching. DMJ activity has been identified in each of these cognitive meta-analyses, suggesting it performs a general role in effortful mental activity, while amygdala modulation may reflect changes in the perception of emotional material and affective salience rather than the experience of negative  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  emotion per se. We use the present findings to assess several current neural models of volitional emotion regulation, and we offer revised models with testable hypotheses. In addition, the ‘consensus’ voluntary emotion regulation regions derived from the meta-analysis may be useful in formulating anatomically specific hypotheses in future studies. To facilitate such efforts, we have made the maps used here available for download on our website (http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/tor/). I65 SPATIAL ATTENTION RELATED AMYGDALA ACTIVITY TO MASKED FEARFUL FACES Joshua Carlson1, Karen Reinke1,2; 1Southern Illinois University Carbondale, 2University of Illinois at Springfield — Neuroimaging studies indicate that nonconscious fearful faces activate the amygdala, superior colliculus, and pulvinar. It has been suggested that these structures form a subcortical fear network involved in automatic alerting. While behavioral studies indicate that nonconscious fearful faces modulate spatial attention the amygdala’s role in this behavior has yet to be assessed. Twelve participants performed a modified dot probe task while fMRI activity was recorded. Each trial consisted of two faces (from Gur et al, 2002) simultaneously presented (33 ms) to the left and right of fixation and immediately masked by neutral faces (100 ms), followed by a target dot. Participants then indicated which side of the screen the target dot appeared. Directed attention trials consist of one fearful and one neutral 33 ms face while undirected attention trials consist of either both fearful or both neutral 33 ms faces. Behavioral results revealed faster reaction times for fear congruent relative to incongruent trials in the LVF. Amygdala ROIs were created using MARINA to assess its role in the processing of masked fearful faces and spatial attention. Consistent with previous research, we found increased bilateral amygdala activity for nonconscious fearful relative to neutral faces independent of spatial attention. However, of greater interest is the novel finding that directed spatial attention elicited by LVF masked fearful faces is associated with increased left amygdala activity compared to undirected attention. Therefore, both behavioral and fMRI data reveal LVF spatial attention effects for nonconscious fearful faces. I66 WORKING MEMORY LOAD MODULATES PROCESSING OF IGNORED EMOTIONAL STIMULI David Carmel1,2,3,4, Emma Jane Bradford1, Geraint Rees2,3, Nilli Lavie1,2; 1University College London, London, UK, 2Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, UK, 3Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK, 4New York University, New York — Executive control processes such as working memory may be critical for reducing interference from irrelevant distractors, by maintaining current processing priorities. Previous evidence regarding whether the processing of emotional stimuli is subject to attentional control has been mixed. Here we investigate the role of working memory in the processing of task-irrelevant emotional stimuli. Participants categorized the affective valence of words (positive or negative). On each trial, the target word was superimposed on an affective face, which participants were instructed to ignore, and which was either congruent or incongruent with the word’s valence. This task was performed while retaining one (low load) or six (high load) digits in working memory. Two experiments using different negative distractor faces (sad and angry) showed that under high (compared to low) working memory load, reaction times in the word categorization task were longer for incongruent faces than for congruent faces, and this difference was greater under high working memory load. Loading working memory therefore increased interference from the concurrently presented affective faces. We also found that negative faces were more distracting than positive faces, and angry faces were more distracting than sad faces. These results suggest that Lavie’s load theory of attention (e.g. Lavie, 2005) can be extended to emotional stimuli, and support the view that emotional stimuli are amenable to cognitive control. Lavie, N. (2005). Distracted and confused?: selective attention under load. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 75-82.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  279  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I67 FEAR AND DISGUST HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON ATTENTION AND MEMORY Hanah Chapman1, Kristen Johannes1, Adam Anderson1,2; 1University of Toronto, 2Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Health — Introduction: Basic emotions models claim that the affective domain is comprised of discrete emotions, such as anger, fear, joy etc. By contrast, dimensional models maintain that all emotions are just combinations of simpler dimensions, such as valence and arousal. Most previous research on the mnemonic effects of emotion has adopted a dimensional framework, focusing on the memory-enhancing effects of arousal. However, the effects of different basic emotions on memory remain largely unexplored. We therefore investigated the impact of two negative, highly arousing emotions—disgust and fear—on memory, while simultaneously examining their role in modulating attention. Because disgust and fear have similar dimensionality, a dimensional model predicts that they should have similar cognitive effects, while a basic emotions model predicts that their effects may differ. Method: To test these predictions, participants viewed neutral as well as disgusting and fearful photographs of equivalent valence and arousal, with a horizontal line above or below each photograph. The task was to indicate the location of the line as quickly as possible. Reaction times were significantly slower for disgusting vs. fearful images, suggesting greater attentional capture by disgust than fear. Memory was tested with a recall test 10 min after encoding. Recall of disgusting and fearful photographs was enhanced equivalently, compared to neutral images. Conclusion: Disgust and fear had similar effects on memory, but different effects on attention. Thus, a dimensional model may best capture the mnemonic effects of different emotions, while a basic emotions model may best account for their attentional effects. I68 INFANTS’ ATTENTION TO EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS: EVIDENCE FOR UNIVERSAL BIASES AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES Frances Chen1, Susan Johnson1; 1Stanford University — Research has shown that facial expressions of emotion influence attentional processes in adults. Generally, spatial attention is more strongly captured and held by negative than neutral expressions (cf., Dolan, 2002). Depressed individuals are biased toward sad faces (Gotlib et al., 2004); anxious individuals toward angry faces (Fox el al., 2002). Our study investigated whether (1) emotional expressions exert similar influences in infancy, (2) such effects are lateralized, and (3) individual differences could be predicted by disorganized behavior in the Ainsworth’s (1972) Strange Situation—a risk factor for later psychopathology. We tested 32 thirteen-month-olds, showing randomized, centrally-presented pictures of a single woman producing neutral, fearful, angry, sad, and happy expressions. 1000 ms after the infant fixated the face, it was replaced by a small target to the far left or right. Latency to shift attention away from the central fixation was measured. A repeated-measures ANOVA was run with expression and target side as within-subject variables. Infants disengaged more slowly from some expressions than others (F=6.54, p<.001). Both fear and anger took significantly longer to disengage from than neutral (p <.001 and p<.05 by simple contrast tests.) Infants were also slower to disengage from the faces when the target appeared in the left visual field (F=6.43, p<.02), suggesting a right hemisphere emotion processing bias. The interaction between expression and disorganization (a between-subject variable) was also significant (F=2.82, p<.03). To our knowledge, these results provide the first direct evidence that universal biases and individual differences exist in infants’ attention to emotional expressions. I69 SUBLIMINALLY-ACTIVATED EMOTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BIAS DECISION MAKING Kuan-Hua Chen1, Nai-Shing Yen1,2, HuiKuan Chung1; 1National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan, 2Research  280  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  Center for Mind, Brain, and Learning, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan — The Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH) proposed Somatic Marker (SM) can operate to bias decision making without coming into consciousness (Bechara et al., 1997). However, other studies suggested that the role of consciousness might be underestimated in SMH (e.g., Maia & McClelland, 2004). For the reason, the aim of this study was to reexamine the role of consciousness in SMH via a revised Iowa Gambling Task. In the revised Iowa Gambling Task, we controlled the expected values of the four decks to rule out the confounding of conscious operation. On the other hand, 10 positive and 10 negative pictures from IAPS were subliminally presented when subjects made card selection. Specifically, two decks were always associated with positive pictures (i.e., P-decks) whereas the other two decks were always associated with negative pictures (i.e., N-decks). It was hypothesized that the subliminally-presented pictures could make different emotions being generated and being attached to different decks. Then, as SMs, these emotions would reappear before card selection to make subjects approach to P-decks or withdraw from N-decks. Results from 24 Taiwanese undergraduates showed that SCRs were higher after P-decks selection than after N-decks selection (marginally significant). More importantly, SCRs were significantly higher before P-decks selection than before N-decks selection. However, regarding to the number of card selection from decks, no difference was revealed. The findings in this study altogether suggested that the emotions which were activated by subliminally-presented can reappear before decision making. However, these subliminally-activated emotions were not sufficient to bias decision making. I70 PICTURE CONTENT VARIATION IN EMOTION RELATED P3 AND LPP Hui-Kuan Chung1, Kuan-Hua Chen1, Nai-Shing Yen1,2; 1National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan, 2Research Center for Mind, Brain, and Learning, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan — The emotion related P3 and late positive potential (LPP) are suggested to be related to increased attentive processing to emotional visual stimulus (Cuthbert et al., 2000). Accordingly, it is argued that, among positive or negative pictures, content variance might be expected because it is no doubt that some kinds of pictures (e.g., erotic couples) are easier to catch one’s attention than some other kinds of pictures (e.g., food). Anokhin et al. (2006) demonstrated that viewing erotic pictures were related to larger positivity from 200 to 600 ms post-stimulus. However, it is notable that, in their study, (a) content variance among negative pictures was not reported; and (b) given that the LPP can sustain to 6000 ms post-stimulus, they only analyze the data from 0 to 3000 ms. For these reasons, the study of Cuthbert et al. (2000) was replicated and the 18 positive and the 18 negative pictures were categorized into erotic and non-erotic, attack/mutilation and non-attack/mutilation respectively. In addition, the epoch of 120 to 6000 ms was used. Sixteen Taiwanese graduate and undergraduate students were recruited. Results indicated that both P3 and LPP were higher for erotic than for non-erotic pictures, and were higher for attack/ mutilation than for non-attack/mutilation pictures. Furthermore, the content effects were announced even to 5000-6000 ms post-stimulus. As the results, the findings in this study extend the findings by Anokhin et al., and confirm the suggestion that the emotion related P3 and LPP might relate to attentive processes. I71 PREDICTING INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN DOPAMINEINDUCED REWARD AND PUNISHMENT BIASES. A PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL PET STUDY. Roshan Cools1,2, Sasha Gibbs2, Asako Miyakawa2, William Jagust2, Mark D\\'Esposito2; 1FC Donders Centre, Radboud University Nijmegen, 2University of California, Berkeley — Adequate adaptation to our constantly changing environment requires the anticipation of biologically relevant events by learning signals of their occurrence, i.e. reward and punishment prediction. This learning critically depends on our ability to respond to unexpected rewards and unexpected punishments. Here we investigated the role of dopamine in  \\x0cPoster Session I  responsiveness to unexpected outcomes during an observational reversal learning task by assessing the effects of oral administration of bromocriptine (a dopamine D2 receptor agonist; 1.25mg) to eleven young healthy volunteers. Previous research has revealed that there is large variability in the direction and extent of dopaminergic drug effects. We aimed to elucidate the neurobiological basis of this large variability by combining neurochemical (fluorometatyrosine) PET imaging and behavioural psychopharmacology. The results indicate that the effects of bromocriptine on responsiveness to unexpected outcomes can be predicted from dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum (r = 0.9). Furthermore, we found contrasting effects of bromocriptine on reward and punishment responsiveness, so that the drug induced either a bias away from reward towards punishment or vice versa. Specifically, bromocriptine increased reward responsiveness but reduced punishment responsiveness in subjects with low dopamine synthesis capacity. Conversely, the drug reduced reward responsiveness but increased punishment responsiveness in subjects with high dopamine synthesis capacity. These data demonstrate that baseline levels of dopamine synthesis predict dopamineinduced biases in reinforcement-based learning and adaptation.

Rumination may also enhance cognitive biases by increasing affective responses to negative material, increasing access to negative memories, and diminishing successful regulation of affect. It is important, therefore, to understand the basis of rumination, including its neural substrates. The present study was designed to use fMRI to examine rumination in depressed and healthy control individuals. Depressed (MDD) and control (CTL) participants underwent functional imaging while focusing on blocks of statements: Rumination, Abstract Distraction, Concrete Distraction, and a Fixation (Baseline) condition. Compared with CTLs, MDD participants exhibited increased activation in emotion processing centers (i.e., amygdala, rostral anterior cingulate, subgenual cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex) and in areas associated with autobiographical memory (i.e., parahippocampus) during ruminative self-focus conditions contrasted with distraction conditions. Further, percent signal change in the amygdala was found to be significantly correlated with self-reported rumination. Interestingly, MDD participants also exhibited increased activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex across all of the contrasts, suggesting that during ruminative self-focus depressed individuals may attempt to engage in more effortful regulation than do controls. These findings represent the first examination of the network of neural regions involved in ruminative selffocus in depressed individuals and add to our growing understanding of the ways in which the brain is dysregulated in major depression. I73 THE TIME COURSE OF PROCESSING EMOTIONAL PROSODY: BEHAVIORAL AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS Lauren Cornew1, Leslie Carver1, Tracy Love1,2; 1University of California, San Diego, 2San Diego State University — Research focusing on emotion processing in the visual modality suggests an advantage for emotionally salient stimuli; however, it remains unclear whether a similar bias exists in the auditory modality. The experiments presented here were designed to test for enhanced processing of emotional stimuli in the domain of speech prosody. We first utilized a gating paradigm and presented participants with successive 250ms segments of Jabberwocky ‘sentences.’ One group of participants heard sentences spo-  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  ken with happy, angry, or neutral intonation and indicated the emotion conveyed following each segment. In a second group of participants, half distinguished between happy and neutral prosody, and the other half distinguished between angry and neutral prosody. Results indicated that both groups identified neutral prosody more rapidly and accurately than happy or angry prosody, arguing against a processing advantage for emotional compared to neutral prosody. To further investigate the time course of emotional prosody processing, and to examine whether our results reflect a bias in perception or attention, we are currently collecting data in a complementary event-related potential (ERP) study. The same happy, angry, and neutral Jabberwocky stimuli are presented, but in their entirety rather than in the spliced and successively building format utilized previously. These stimuli alternate with sequences of tones ascending, descending, or remaining constant in pitch, and a target detection task allows for manipulation of the task-relevance of emotion. The effects of emotion and task-relevance on components previously linked to attention (including the P300) will be discussed in the context of the aforementioned behavioral findings. I74 GAZE DIRECTION AND FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION IN AMYGDALA-DAMAGED PATIENTS. Chiara Cristinzio1,3,5, Karim N\\'Diaye1,2,3, Margitta Seeck5, Patrik Vuilleumier1,2,5, David Sander3,4; 1Laboratory for Behavioral Neurology and Imaging of Cognition, Geneva, 2University Medical Center, Geneva, 3Swiss Center for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva, 4 University of Geneva, 5University Hospital, Geneva — Past studies have shown a critical role for the amygdala in emotion processing. Bilateral amygdala damage may impair recognition of facial expressions, particularly fear. However effects of unilateral amygdala damage are more controversial: some findings show that unilateral damage is not sufficient to impair emotion recognition, whereas others show selective deficits after right amygdala damage. Various stimulus or task parameters might account for such differences in results, including gaze direction or presence of static vs dynamic cues. These variables have been demonstrated to influence emotion perception. Here we investigate facial emotion recognition and its interaction with gaze in unilateral amygdala-damaged patients (n= 19), compared to healthy control subjects (n= 10), using computer-generated dynamic face stimuli. These faces could express variable intensities of fear, anger, or joy, with different gaze directions. According to appraisal theory, emotion perception depends by self-relevance of the expression. Therefore a fearful face should be more relevant if gaze is averted than direct, because it signals danger near to the observer; whereas anger with direct gaze should be more relevant than with averted gaze, because it directly threatens the observer. Our results confirm a critical role for the amygdala in emotion and appraisal, showing an interaction between gaze and emotion in controls, but not in patients. Moreover, patients showed a general impairment in emotion recognition, especially for fear, but with different profiles depending on the side of lesion (greater deficit for right vs left damage) and age of pathology onset (broader deficits before vs after 7 year-old). I75 AFFECTIVE PRIMING OF PAIN: EFFECTS OF CUE VALENCE AND AROUSAL ON PAIN PERCEPTION Katharine P. Dahl1, Matthew J. Greene1, Tor D. Wager1; 1Columbia University — In this study, we investigate the influence of emotional primes and sympathetic arousal on participants\\' perception of painful stimuli. There are two frequently cited “routes” to how emotional states can affect the experience of pain. The emotional priming hypothesis suggests that exposure to unpleasant images should amplify pain ratings, whereas pleasant images should decrease them. The arousal hypothesis suggests that sympathetic arousal acts to inhibit pain; by this hypothesis, high-arousal images should decrease pain ratings while low arousal images should increase them. To explore these questions, we presented participants with cues that varied systematically in valence and arousal, followed by painful thermal stimuli. Cues included pairs of relatively high-arousal (High) and lower-  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  281  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  arousal (Low) negative, neutral, and positive stimuli. Negative cues were pain-specific (High) and nonspecific (Low) aversive images. Neutral cues were the Valsalva maneuver (blowing against a closed glottis, which elicits sympathetic arousal; High) and neutral images (Low). Positive cues were images indicating wins of $5 cash (High) and positive images (Low). In addition to behavioral measures, skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate were recorded throughout the study. Preliminary results show that, contrary to the arousal hypothesis, pain ratings were higher when preceded by negative, high-arousal cues. Path models relating the experimental manipulations to anticipatory SCR, pain ratings, and pain SCR are presented. I76 NEURAL CORRELATES OF ENVISIONING EMOTIONAL EVENTS IN THE NEAR AND FAR FUTURE Arnaud D\\'Argembeau1,5, Gui 2,3 2,3 1,4 Xue , Zhong-Lin Lu , Martial Van der Linden , Antoine Bechara2,3; 1 University of Liège, Belgium, 2Dana and David Dornsife Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, 3Brain and Creativity Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, 4 University of Geneva, Switzerland, 5Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research, Belgium — Adaptive decision making depends crucially on the ability to mentally simulate emotional situations that might happen in the future. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we addressed the functional neuroanatomy of this process and investigated, in particular, whether distinct brain regions are engaged depending on the perceived temporal distance of the future episodes. Participants imagined positive and negative events that might happen to them in the near future (i.e., in the next few days or weeks) or in the far future (i.e., in at least one year); they were also asked to think of some routine activities (e.g., showering), which served as a control condition. The results showed that envisioning near and far future events recruited the medial prefrontal cortex and medial posterior regions (posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex) to a greater extent than imagining routine activities. More importantly, part of the neural circuit engaged when envisioning the future was modulated by the temporal distance of the events. Specifically, activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC; BA 11) was greater when envisioning emotional events in the far future, whereas the left caudate nucleus responded more to emotional (and especially positive) events in the near future. We argue that the vmPFC might assign emotional values to mental representations of future events that pertain to long-term goals. On the other hand, the caudate might support more concrete simulations of action plans to achieve rewarding situations in the near future. I77 HUMAN AMYGDALA RESPONSES ARE MODULATED BY UNPREDICTABLE PRESENTATIONS OF AMBIGUOUSLY VALENCED FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. Caroline Davis1, Emily Mazzulla2, Jonathan Oler2, Paul Whalen1; 1Dartmouth College, 2University of Wisconsin, Madison — The human amygdala is highly responsive to facial expressions of emotion, particularly expressions with ambiguous predictive value. We have previously shown that habituation rates of amygdala response to facial expressions differ as a function of predictive value. Specifically, amygdala reactivity to clearly negative expressions (e.g., fear) habituates rapidly with repeated presentations, while a sustained response is observed to ambiguously valenced expressions (e.g., surprise). Importantly, the ambiguous predictive value of surprised facial expressions can be resolved with contextual information, and amygdala responsivity is sensitive to such context manipulations. Recent research suggests that the amygdala is also sensitive to subtle contextual manipulations, such as temporal unpredictability, and that such unpredictability primes anxiety-like behaviors. These results suggest that otherwise ambiguous stimuli (such as innocuous tones or surprised faces) may be perceived as negative in an unpredictable context. Based upon our previous data, we hypothesized that an unpredictable context would disambiguate the valence of surprised faces, resulting in habituation of  282  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  amygdala response to these faces. In the present experiment, we used fMRI to examine amygdala responsivity to surprised faces presented in temporally predictable (i.e., constant) and unpredictable (i.e., jittered) sequences. We found that predictable presentations of surprised faces produced moderate but sustained activation of the amygdala over time. Amygdala responses to unpredictable surprised faces were initially greater than those observed to predictable faces. Consistent with our prediction, these responses habituated over time. Future studies will be aimed at determining whether surprised faces presented in an unpredictable fashion are indeed interpreted more negatively. I78 FMRI BOLD SIGNAL AND ENDOCRINE CHANGES IN ELITE SWIMMERS WHILE VIEWING VIDEOS OF SUCCESSFUL AND FAILED PERSONAL PERFORMANCE Henry Davis1, Sari M. van Anders2, Helen S. Mayberg3, Jared X. Van Snellenberg4, Rachel McKay5, Aynsley Smith6, Neil V. Watson5, Todd S. Woodward5, Elton T. Ngan5, Mario Liotti7; 1Swimming Canada, 2Indiana University, 3Emory University, 4Columbia University, 5University of British Columbia, 6Mayo Clinic, 7Simon Fraser University — Athletes who fail may develop negative affect (NA); those who succeed may become happy. We used mood provocation to investigate interrelationships between mood, neural and hormonal activity as internationally competitive athletes engaged in personal self-reference (PSR) by viewing video of a personal competitive performance. As negative provocation 14 athletes watched a PSR of career-threatening failure whereas 12 athletes viewed exceptional, international success as positive provocation. Post-video mood was rated. Neural activation was measured via echoplanar fMRI BOLD signals in two blocks (4-min neutral, 8-min PSR). Salivary hormone measures (testosterone; cortisol) were taken at Time 1 (T1: pre-fMRI blocks) and Time 2 (T2: post-fMRI blocks). Mood provocation produced expected results with successful athletes reporting less NA following the viewing of the PSR video than failed athletes (p<.0001). ANOVA on BOLD activations in regions of interest - premotor and sensorimotor cortices - showed greater activations for successful than failed athletes during viewing of the PSR video (p<.01). There were no group differences in BOLD activity during neutral stimulus viewing. Importantly, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that the ratio of testosterone to cortisol change (T:C) between T1 and T2 increased only among success athletes (p<.01). Right premotor cortex BA6 BOLD activity was positively correlated with this percentage gain in T:C (TCG), computed between T1 and T2 (p<.05). TCG was not significantly correlated with left sensori-motor cortex activity. Overall, the data suggest that negative and positive PSR correspond to interrelated neural and endocrine change. I79 WHO CAUSED THE PAIN? AN FMRI INVESTIGATION OF EMPATHY AND THEORY OF MIND IN CHILDREN Jean Decety1, Kalina Michalska1, Yuko Akitsuki1; 1Social Cognitive Neuroscience, The University of Chicago — When we perceive other people in pain, the neural circuits underpinning the processing of first-hand experience of pain are emulated in the observer. This basic neural mechanism plays a critical role in the primitive building block of empathy that allows emotional contagion and sharing of other’s distress. However the full blown capacity of human empathy is more sophisticated than the mere simulation of the target’s affective state. Indeed, empathy is both about sharing and understanding the emotional state of others in relation to oneself. In this study, a group of typically developing children (7-11 yrs) was scanned while presented with short animated visual stimuli depicting painful and non-painful situations (e.g., hand stuck in a car door). Further, these situations involved either one person whose pain was caused by mistake or inflicted by another social agent. After scanning, children rated how painful these situations were. Consistent with previous functional neuroimaging studies of pain empathy with adults, the perception of other people in pain in children was associated with increased hemodynamic activity in the neural circuits involved in the processing of first-hand  \\x0cPoster Session I  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  experience of pain, including the anterior insula, the aMCC, PAG, and SMA. Interestingly, when another person inflicted pain, regions that are consistently involved in theory of mind and emotion regulation were additionally activated, including medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Childrens’ ratings of pain were higher when pain was caused by another person as compared to pain caused by self, and these ratings were correlated with activity in the ACC.  faces elicited later brain responses than human faces, and were processed differently at the structural level, as indicated by the smaller N170 component. As early as 80 msec post stimulus, occipital responses differentiated neutral from happy faces for robotic as well as for human faces, with P1 wave larger in response to happy than to neutral faces. Taken together, these findings suggest a precedence of emotion perception over recognition of facial identity, when robotic faces are concerned.  I80 INFERRING EMOTIONAL STATES FROM INTENTIONAL ACTION Katrin Döhnel1, Monika Sommer1, Beate Sodian2, Christoph Rothmayr1, Jörg Meinhardt2, Göran Hajak1; 1University of Regensburg, Germany, 2Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Germany — In the course of development, reasoning about emotions precedes false belief reasoning, a critical test for having a Theory of Mind (ToM). In adults, reasoning about others’ emotional states and false belief reasoning activate similar brain regions, like the medial prefrontal cortex, the precuneus and temporal brain regions. By presenting cartoon stories, this fMRI study explored the attribution of a protagonist’s emotion on the basis of its intention and the outcome of the intentional action (intention fulfilled or intention unfulfilled). Emotion attribution conditions were contrasted with a control condition that required reality judgments. Emotion attribution inferred from an unfulfilled intention compared to emotion attribution inferred from a fulfilled intention led to a decrease in functional activity in the rostral part of anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA 32). This finding provides evidence that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is centrally involved in Theory of Mind processing since it extends its role in false belief processing on emotion attribution processes. The result is discussed on the basis of the involvement of the default mode network in mentalizing.  I83 THE EFFECTS OF SLEEP QUALITY ON VISUAL EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING EMOTIONAL INTENSITY OF ANGRY FACIAL STIMULI IN HEALTHY ADULTS. Joey K.-Y. Essoe1, Erin M. Ramage1, Mark W. Geisler1; 1San Francisco State University — Past research established that the amount of sleep (quantity) effects many indices of cognitive performance, including event-related brain potentials (ERP\\'s); however, there is a paucity of research on how the characteristics of sleep (quality) may affect sensory perception and cognition. This study measured amplitude and latency in response to visual ERP\\'s using photographs of angry faces, reaction times, and subjective ratings of anger intensity in 50 (22 male, 28 female) good sleepers (GS) and 18 (9 male, 9 female) poor sleepers (PS) as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Greater amplitude differences were found between early stimulus detection (N1 component) and early sensory processing (P2) in PS as compare to GS, while greater amplitude of cognitive information processing (P3 component) are found in GS as compare to PS. Reaction times were significantly impaired in PS as compared to GS, while no significant difference in the subjective degree of anger ratings was found between the sleep quality groups. These results suggest that greater neuronal resources are allocated toward early cognitive processing and this may be a benefit of good sleep quality. However, there appears to be hyper-arousal in early sensory processing, and delay in reaction times as a result of poorer sleep quality. Thus, sleep quality may play an important role in enabling the brain to detect visual stimuli more quickly, and to process and interpret the stimuli more accurately.  I81 EMOTION RECOGNITION AND MENTALISING IN TOURETTE’S SYNDROME Helena Drury1, Roxanne Barrett1, Mary-Beth Young1, Jeremy Stern2, Mary Robertson2, Shelley Channon1; 1University College London, UK, 2St. George\\'s Hospital, London, UK — Tourette’s syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the core symptomatology consists of motor and vocal tics. It has been linked to a range of everyday problems including social difficulties and inappropriate behaviours, but these may be primarily attributable to comorbid psychiatric symptomatology. Brain regions thought to be disrupted in TS have been linked to emotion recognition, mentalising, and executive functions. The present study compared adults with uncomplicated TS with a matched healthy control group. Recognition of emotional faces was intact for the TS group. Prosody recognition was also intact for neutral, happy and sad emotional voices, but there was evidence of mild weakness in anger recognition. On the faux pas test, a social cognition task with separate scores for affective and cognitive mentalising, the TS group showed greater variability than controls. Implications of the findings for our understanding of TS are considered. I82 HOW HUMAN BRAIN PERCEIVE EMOTIONAL ROBOTIC FACES Stephanie Dubal1, Aurélie Foucher1, Maud Simon1, Pierre Canet1, Roland Jouvent1, Jacqueline Nadel1; 1CNRS_UPMC Emotion Center, CHU Pitié-Salpétrière — Emotional facial expression can affect cortical processing at very short latencies: the occipital P1 component amplitude, peaking at about 100 ms post stimulus, is modulated by emotional content. Later, at about 170 ms post stimulus, the N170 component is generally modulated by facial identity. In this study, we used recordings of eventrelated brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate how human brain perceives robotic compared to human facial expressions of emotion. Stimuli consisted of pictures from 4 different robotic heads displaying happy or neutral expressions that were intermixed with pictures of human expression drawn from Ekman’s set of prototypical facial expressions. 15 participants were asked to distinguish neutral from joy by pressing a button. Like human faces, robotic faces elicited a N170 wave, though not as large and later. Human faces were processed faster than robotic faces, with earlier P1 component, N170 component and shorter reaction times. Robotic  I84 DEFAULT-NETWORK FMRI ACTIVATION AND RESPONSE-TIME VARIABILITY IN TRAIT ANXIETY. Christina Fales1, Todd Braver1, Jeremy Gray2, Deanna Barch1; 1Washington University in St. Louis, 2Yale University — Trait-anxious individuals report difficulties concentrating but increases in attentional lapses during emotionally-neutral tasks have been difficult to document. Anxious participants do not always show response time (RT) differences during working memory (WM) tasks, and neuro-imaging studies have tended to show increased recruitment of WM areas during such tasks, rather than reduced. Recently, activation levels in default-network brain regions have been linked to the occurrence of attentional lapses, and deactivation in some of these regions has been associated with response time improvements during cognitive tasks. In the current study we conducted a mixed (blocked & eventrelated) fMRI neuro-imaging study of high and low-anxious participants during a working memory task. High-anxious subjects showed reduced sustained fMRI activation in working-memory brain regions and reduced sustained activation (increased deactivation) in default regions. Behaviorally, the two groups showed no differences in accuracy rates, mean response times, or RT standard deviations. We then conducted an exGaussian analysis of RT variability that provides separate parameter estimates for mean-RT values (mu), mean-RT variability (sigma) and extreme-RT values (tau). Activity in working-memory regions showed no relationship with any of the ex-Gaussian measures. Similarly, defaultnetwork activity showed no such relationship in low-anxious participants. However, in the high-anxious, sustained levels of default-network activity were significantly positively correlated with mu and sigma values, while transient levels were significantly related to tau estimates. These findings support the idea that deactivation in default-mode regions may be related to maintenance of attentional focus, and that such processing may be relatively more important for anxious individuals.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  283  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I85 COGNITIVE CONTROL PROCESSES DURING ENCODING OF AFFECTIVE STIMULI– AN FMRI STUDY IN PTSD Kristina Fast1, 1 1 2 Christine Amrhein , Franziska Meister , Dorothea Huber , Günther Klug2, Thomas Meindl3; 1University Hospital of Psychiatry, Ludwig-MaximiliansUniversity of Munich, Munich, Germany, 2Psychosomatic ClinicHarlaching, Munich, Germany, 3Institute of Clinical Radiology, Ludwig-MaximiliansUniversity of Munich, Munich, Germany — Studies on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) show that these patients are characterized by impairments of memory. Different implicit and explict strategies may help to keep traumatic contents away from awareness. These processes might have be risk factors for developing and maintaining PTSD. In the present study, we aimed to examine the role of cognitive control during encoding and retrieval of emotional (trauma-related) word stimuli in patients with PTSD. We used a so-called “directed forgetting” paradigm and an emotional stroop paradigm, with additional registration of fMRI brain activity. Our results are in accordance with the hypothesis that attention and inhibition have a crucial impact in episodic memory in general, but in particular, in modulating the processing of affective stimuli. We conclude that PTSD patients draw their attention away from the traumatic content, making it difficult for them to voluntarily influence the encoding of aversive trauma-related stimuli. Notably, this effect was accompanied by an activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal cortex / anterior cingulate, brain areas linked to executive control functions and volitional inhibition and modulation of emotions, especially regarding negative emotional content. I86 BILATERAL AMYGDALA DAMAGE DOES NOT IMPAIR RAPID DETECTION OF FEARFUL FACES Csilla Felsen1, Naotsugu Tsuchiya1, Farshad Moradi1,2, Ralph Adolphs1,3; 1California Institute of Technology, 2New York University, 3University of Iowa — Lesion and imaging studies have shown that the amygdala is important to fear perception, but it remains unknown at what stage of face processing it plays a critical role. One hypothesis is that the amygdala participates in early fear detection via a putative rapid subcortical pathway that bypasses the geniculo-cortical pathway. To test this hypothesis, we performed two psychophysical experiments on patient SM, who has complete amygdala lesions and is impaired on fear recognition tasks that permit free viewing without time constraints. In the first rapid categorization task, we briefly (40 msec) presented side-by-side two faces of the same identity, one with a neutral and the other with an emotional expression. Subjects pressed a button to indicate which of the two was the emotional face, and were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. In the second task, we used a more complex visual search array of a set of several morphed faces ranging from fear to neutral as target and distractors. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, SM did not show any impairment on either task. In the rapid categorization task, SM was as fast and as accurate as the controls. In the visual search task, she showed category boundary effects with search slopes (i.e. speed of detection per item) comparable to controls. Taken together, our results suggest that the amygdala is not necessary for early and rapid detection of fear, but that it comes into play in later judgment and recognition. I87 NEURAL SYSTEMS OF VISUAL ATTENTION RESPOND TO EMOTIONAL SYMBOLIC HAND GESTURES Tobias Flaisch1, Harald Schupp1; 1University of Konstanz — Emotional cues guide selective attention. Specifically, erotic displays, emotional facial expressions, as well as body posture elicit enhanced activation in associative visual processing areas. Theoretically, selective processing of evolutionary relevant stimuli may reflect phylogenetic heritage and ontogenic experiences. To isolate ontogenetic processes, the present study examined hand gestures with symbolic emotional meaning. The processing of the sexually insulting middle finger jerk gesture was compared to the thumb up gesture signaling approval and a non-emotional control gesture, the forefinger point.  284  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  While being scanned in a 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging machine, thirty volunteers viewed images of these hand gestures displayed by 8 models. Stimuli were grouped into 12s-blocks of a single stimulus condition, interleaved with 12s-fixation periods. The three conditions were presented in a perceptually random order and each condition was repeated 14 times. Expectations regarding reported level of emotional valence and arousal and knowledge about the semantic meaning of each gesture were confirmed. As compared to the affectively neutral forefinger point gesture, passive viewing of both the offensive middle finger jerk, as well as the approving thumb up gesture resulted in increased BOLD-activity in extrastriate visual cortex. The main loci of these effects were observed dorsally in parieto-occipital areas and also covered temporo-occipital regions. These results show that culturally transmitted symbolic gestures of threat and approval direct perceptual processing similar to evolutionary relevant emotional cues. I88 LONG TERM INTEGRATION OF REINFORCEMENT PROBABILITY AND MAGNITUDE: NEUROCOMPUTATIONAL AND GENETIC COMPONENTS Michael Frank1, Bradley Doll1; 1University of Arizona — Computational modeling suggests that the basal ganglia (BG) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) contribute differentially to reward-based decision making (Frank & Claus, 2006). Whereas the BG can integrate the long term probability of reinforcement via changes in synaptic weights driven by phasic dopamine signals, the PFC is specialized to maintain the magnitudes of recent reinforcement values in a working memory-like state. A recent genetic study identified three genes controlling striatal and prefrontal dopaminergic function which independently modulated different aspects of reinforcement learning in a probabilistic selection task. The striatal genes predicted long-term positive and negative probability learning, whereas the prefrontal gene predicted trial-to-trial adaption requiring working memory for recent negative outcomes. However, it was not tested in that study whether prefrontal genes contribute differentially to learning about reinforcement magnitudes, as compared with their probability. Here we introduce two novel frequency-magnitude tasks designed to measure the degree to which participants learn about positive and negative reinforcement probabilities versus their magnitudes. Pilot studies tuned task parameters such that on average half of participants preferred higher reward probabilities, and half preferred large reinforcement magnitudes. We will report results from approximately 70 subjects to determine whether these biases can be predicted by striatal and prefrontal genetic markers. Behavioral data will also be fit with computational reinforcement learning algorithms designed to find best fitting parameters (learning rates, sensitivity to magnitude, etc) to each subject and whether these parameters are predictably modulated by genotype. I89 EFFECT OF EMOTION REGULATION ON REWARD PROCESSING: PRELIMINAL INVESTIGATION WITH EVENTRELATED POTENTIALS Hirokata Fukushima1, Kazuo Hiraki1; 1The University of Tokyo — Reward processing is considered to inherently involve emotional processing. However, neural correlates of emotional process under reward perception has rarely, at least in human electrophysiology, been nvestigated,. This study aimed to shed light on emotional characteristic in reward processing, by examining whether the volitional effort of emotion regulation would modulate the ERP components eminent in reward processing, i.e. Feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300. Being measured ERPs, subjects performed a simple gambling task under two within-subject experimental conditions; up-regulation and down-regulation conditions. In the up-regulation condition, subjects were instructed to try to mentally behave like a highly-emotional person concerning the gambling task. In the down-regulation condition, subjects were tried to be a calm and less-emotional person. After each block, the subjects scored the degree of subjective emotional impact in the task. Those scores confirmed that the subjects could, at least in terms of  \\x0cPoster Session I  subjective feelings, regulate up and down the emotional impact inherent in the gambling task. ERP results showed that the subjects’ effort of emotion regulation influenced only P300, but not FRN: P300 amplitude was significantly larger in up-regulation than down-regulation condition. It has been known that the amplitude of FRN reflects motivation, stress, or affective states, but not reflects magnitude of reward. Along with these knowledge, our data will provide further insight about relationship among reward, emotion, and conscious awareness of them. I90 ATTENTION AND AMYGDALA ACTIVATION IN SPIDER PHOBIA Antje B.M. Gerdes1, Georg W. Alpers1,3, Bernadette Lagarie2, Katharina Tabbert2, Dieter Vaitl2, Rudolf Stark2; 1University of Würzburg, 2 University of Giessen, 3University of Bielefeld — In theory, threat detection operates on an automatic level and should therefore activate the amygdala independently from allocation of attention. However, previous studies using emotional facial expressions or phobic cues yielded contradictory results. We used fMRI to examine whether different attentional allocation influences amygdala activation. Nineteen spider-phobic women were instructed to pay attention to and identify as quickly as possible either a moving or a stationary animal in briefly presented doubleexposure displays. Compared to congruent neutral displays (two birds), amygdala activation was most pronounced in response to congruent phobic displays (two spiders) and less but still significant in response to mixed displays (spider and bird) when attention was focused on the phobic component. When attention was focused on the neutral component, mixed displays did not result in significant amygdala activation. This was confirmed in a significant parametric graduation of the amygdala activation in the order of congruent phobic displays, mixed displays with attention focus on the spider, mixed displays with focus on the bird and congruent neutral displays. These results show that attention does modulate amygdala activation in response to briefly presented phobic cues. I91 INFLUENCES OF TESTOSTERONE, AGGRESSION AND ANGER ON ULTIMATUM GAME BEHAVIOR Shauna Gordon-McKeon1, Noah Isserman2, Cynthia Gill1; 1Hampshire College, 2Amherst College — Research suggests that during the economic decision-making game known as the Ultimatum Game players tend to reject low offers from another player despite the fact that this leaves both players with nothing. Some researchers believe this behavior is driven by a negative emotional response such as anger (Pillutla and Murninhan, 1996), rather than an abstract sense of fairness. Anger, especially in response to a challenge, has been linked to the androgen hormone testosterone. In this study, participants were asked to accept or reject fair and unfair offers in a sham Ultimatum Game network. They were then asked to make offers to others in the network. Rates of offers and of rejection were examined in relation to saliva testosterone levels, digit ratio, and scores on the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPA). Significant correlations were found between rejection rates and scores on the anger subscale of the BPA (offers of two: r = .44, p = .04; three: r = .49, p = .02). Additionally, low offers were correlated with a low digit ratio (r = .41, p = .02) supporting previous research (Van den Bergh and DeWitte, 2006). However, there was no correlation between saliva testosterone and Ultimatum Game behavior. This suggests that while Ultimatum Game behavior may be determined in part by a tendency towards aggression and high prenatal testosterone (supported by correlations with digit ratio), it is not influenced by, nor does it influence, dynamic testosterone levels (reflected in saliva testosterone level). I92 SNAKE PHOBICS ANTICIPATING AND RESPONDING TO SNAKES: SKIN CONDUCTANCE RESPONSES AND FMRI Danielle Green1, Deborah Kerr1, Tim Flink1, Issidoros Sarinopoulos1,3, Jack Nitschke1,2; 1University of Wisconsin, Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior, 2University of Wisconsin, 3Michigan State University — Anticipation and uncontrollability have been implicated as major contributors  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  to anxiety disorders (Barlow, 2002). Previous research has found that in anticipation of threatening stimuli, various areas of the brain along with the sympathetic nervous system (autonomic markers like skin conductance response) are activated abnormally in anxiety disorders. The current research explores the link between brain areas activated in snake phobia – amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) – and skin conductance response (SCR) in the anticipation of, and response to, aversive stimuli in both specific phobia and non-phobic controls. In the present event-related fMRI study, SCR was collected while participants viewed snake, fish and disgust videos preceded by cues that were the first letter of each stimulus type: S, F, and D. Preliminary results show greatest SCRs in phobics during the anticipation of snake cues compared to fish and disgust cues. Controllability modulates these responses, with phobics showing greater SCRs to controllable vs. uncontrollable snake cues. For the response portion of the task, phobics show significant SCRs while viewing both snake and disgust videos compared to fish. Preliminary analyses suggest associations between these SCRs and previously reported amygdala, insula, and ACC activations in anticipation of and response to snake stimuli among snake phobics. These results confirm the hypothesis that SCRs in phobics would be greatest in anticipation of and response to snakes, consistent with amygdala, insula, and ACC activations in the same subjects, and suggest that autonomic arousal is modulated by controllability for phobogenic and aversive cues. I93 AMYGDALA REACTIVITY TO FACIAL EXPRESSIONS: SELECTIVITY, LATERALITY AND GENDER DIFFERENCES Tsafrir Greenberg1, Merav Shor1, Lilianne Mujica-Parodi1; 1Stony Brook University — Despite growing evidence for the amygdala’s role in emotional processing that extends beyond fear, studies presenting facial stimuli have reported mixed findings regarding amygdala reactivity to different emotional expressions. Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent activation is lateralized in response to these and other emotional stimuli and whether differences in patterns of activation exist between men and women. To address these issues, we performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan in 66 healthy individuals while they passively viewed angry, neutral, happy and fearful faces. Our large sample size permitted us to investigate more closely the role of selectivity, laterality and gender differences in amygdala-activation patterns within a healthy population. Random-effects analyses revealed significant bilateral activation for each of the facial expressions relative to baseline. In order to assess laterality differences in the blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) response we performed an analysis of variance on parameter estimates extracted from each amygdala. There was a significant main effect for laterality with greater activation on the left side. Follow-up pairwise comparisons were significant for the angry and neutral faces only. Overall, men and women exhibited equivalent patterns of activation, for all facial expressions, except for greater activation in women in response to the angry faces. The present findings provide support for an amygdalar role in processing facial expressions beyond fear with predominant activation of the left amygdala. Similar activation patterns across gender groups suggest that other factors, besides gender, may more reliably account for variability across participants. I94 INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXECUTIVE CONTROL OF ATTENTION AND EMPATHY Xiaosi Gu1, Jin Fan1, Xun Liu1, Kevin Guise1, John Fossella2; 1Mount Sinai School of Medicine, 2Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University — The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and fronto-insular cortex (FI) are involved in multiple aspects of cognition and emotion. Meta-analysis has shown that the ACC and FI are critical regions in executive control of attention. Recent brain imaging studies have shown that the ACC and FI are also involved in social cognition such as empathy, the ability to infer and generate sensory and emotional experiences of other people. Given that the executive control of attention and empathy are  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  285  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  Poster Session I  supported by ACC and FI as the essential structures, we predicted that the behavioral measurements of these two cognitive processes should be highly correlated. In the current behavioral study we investigated the functional relationship between executive control and empathy. Executive control of attention was tested using the Attention Network Test (ANT). Empathy was assessed by showing a set of 256 photographs we have recent developed with left/right hand/foot in either painful or context-matched non-painful situations, to effectively induce empathetic responses. Participants were asked to judge how painful the situation was. In addition we administered the Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ) and the Empathy Quotient (EQ). The correlation coefficients between executive control and empathy measures were examined. Results were further discussed with regard to the role of ACC and FI in executive control of attention and empathy.  13 females) and middle-SES (n=25, 16 females) African-American adolescents were administered a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test in groups of 2 or 3, with 10 measurements of salivary cortisol taken throughout the procedure. A preliminary analysis (n=43) using a mixed model ANOVA with an unstructured covariance matrix showed no main effect of SES on overall cortisol levels and no Time x SES interaction, indicating no difference between low- and middle-SES groups in their cortisol response to the stressor. However, there was a significant Time x Gender x SES interaction: (1) males showed a larger response to the stressor than females; (2) low-SES females showed a larger response to the stressor than middle-SES females; and (3) low-SES males showed a higher but delayed peak cortisol response than middle-SES males. Results suggest that SES is an important predictor of cortisol reactivity to social stress in adolescents but this relationship is dependent on gender.  I95 THE HUMAN EMOTIONAL BRAIN WITHOUT SLEEP: A PREFRONTAL-AMYGDALA DISCONNECT Ninad Gujar1, SeungSchik Yoo2, Peter Hu1, Matthew Walker1; 1Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, 2Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston — Introduction: A commonly reported consequence of sleep-deprivation is altered mood and affect. Furthermore, a hallmark feature of many affective psychiatric conditions is abnormal sleep. Here, we investigated the neural impact of sleep-deprivation on the evaluation of negative emotional stimuli using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: Subjects (n=26) were either sleep-deprived for 35hr (deprivation group) or allowed to sleep normally (control group) before performing an emotional picture-slide assessment during fMRI scanning. Subjects viewed a series of standardized emotional pictures, ranging form neutral to increasingly negative and aversive, and made an emotional strength judgment to each. Results: Both groups demonstrated limbic brain activation to increasingly negative stimuli, specifically in bilateral amygdala regions. However, the sleep-deprived group expressed a far more profound, hyper-reactive amygdala response; levels that were +60% more intense than the control group (P=0.004). Moreover, sleep-deprived subjects expressed a three-fold increase in the extent of amygdala activated in response to the negative stimuli (P=0.009). Most interestingly, there was a significant loss of functional connectivity between the amygdale and the medial-prefrontal cortex (MPFC) following sleep-deprivation. Discussion: Together, these data demonstrate an amplified, hyper-limbic response by the human amygdala to negative stimuli under conditions of sleep-deprivation, associated with a functional disconnection with the MPFC. It therefore appears that sleep may “reset” the correct brain reactivity to next-day emotional and psychosocial challenges. Such findings provide new insights into the relationship between sleep loss and affective moods disorders, hostile and nonoptimal decision-making in sleep-curtailed work personnel, and more generally, emotional irrationality in an increasingly sleep-deprived society.  I97 BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL CORRELATES OF EMPATHY IN DEPRESSION Julie L. Hall1, Marc G. Berman1, Vincent A. Magnotta2, Hanna Damasio3, Thad A. Polk1, Stephanie D. Preston1; 1University of Michigan, 2University of Iowa, 3University of Southern California — Depression has consistently been linked to deficits in affective and cognitive processing. However, little research has investigated the relationship between empathy and depression. Using an fMRI block design, the current study investigated the behavioral, psychophysiological, and neural correlates of empathy in 11 depressed and 18 nondepressed women. Participants watched thirteen videos, in which real patients were interviewed about their experience with chronic and terminal illness. After each video, participants provided self-report ratings about their emotions (e.g., personal distress, empathy, positive and negative emotion) and helping behavior (e.g., how much help the patient needed, their willingness to offer help). Data from both groups generally supported behavioral research on empathy in that personal distress and empathy were positively correlated and activated similar brain regions. In addition, empathy was more strongly associated with willingness to offer help compared to personal distress. However, depressed women showed greater emotional responses to the videos and did not demonstrate the typical decrease in empathy and helping for highly distressing situations, differences which were mirrored in the fMRI data. Our findings provide novel evidence that depression may actually increase empathy and helping, which may be because depressed individuals can better relate to others’ distress. Our data support a Perception-Action Model of empathy, which emphasizes the need for common past experiences and overlapping neural representations for empathy to occur. However, they also suggest that an inability to down-regulate negative emotions and helping behavior to others’ distress may be an important factor in the development and maintenance of depression.  I96 SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND STRESS PHYSIOLOGY: ACUTE CORTISOL RESPONSE TO A SOCIAL STRESSOR IN ADOLESCENTS. Daniel A. Hackman1, Laura Betancourt2, Hallam Hurt2, Robert J. Gallop3, Martha J. Farah1; 1University of Pennsylvania, 2Division of Neonatology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 3Applied Statistics Program, West Chester University — One mechanism hypothesized to underlie the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive development is early life-stress and its influence on the basal functioning and reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Higher baseline levels of cortisol have been found in children and adults of lower SES, while previous work in our lab demonstrated a relationship between early-life home experiences and medial-temporal memory in adolescence. No studies, however, have directly examined if SES predicts both baseline levels of cortisol and reactivity to a social stressor in adolescents. Low-SES (n=18,  286  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  I98 NEURAL CORRELATES OF MORAL SENSITIVITY IN AN ADULT INCARCERATED POPULATION Carla L. Harenski1, Keith A. Harenski1, Matthew S. Shane1, Kent A. Kiehl1,2; 1The MIND Institute, 2 University of New Mexico — The neural correlates of moral appraisals have been well studied in healthy populations, but have been less studied in individuals who may have diminished moral sensitivity (e.g. brain damaged patients, criminal populations). The purpose of the current study was to obtain converging behavioral and neural evidence of diminished moral sensitivity in an incarcerated population. The primary hypothesis was that behavioral indices of diminished moral sensitivity would be associated with reduced activity in brain regions associated with moral appraisal, including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was collected from 40 incarcerated adult males on a mobile scanner (1.5T) while they viewed 50 unpleasant pictures, 25 of which depicted moral violations (moral) and 25 without moral violations (non-moral). Moral and nonmoral pictures were matched on emotional arousal and social complex-  \\x0cPoster Session I  ity. Participants rated each picture according to the degree of moral violation they perceived (1=none, 5=severe). Moral sensitivity (defined as the mean difference in moral severity rating between moral and non-moral pictures) was highly variable across participants, ranging from -0.15 to 3.78. This variability was substantially higher than in previous normative samples (Harenski et al., 2006; 2007). fMRI results indicated increased mPFC, pSTS, and PCC activity when viewing moral relative to non-moral pictures. Moral sensitivity was positively correlated with mPFC and PCC activity (but not pSTS). These results suggest that reduced moral sensitivity in incarcerated populations is associated with reduced activity in brain regions associated with moral appraisal. I99 BRAIN STRUCTURE CORRELATES OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE ACQUISITION AND REGULATION OF CONDITIONED FEAR. Catherine Hartley1, Janelle Szary1, Bruce Fischl2, Elizabeth Phelps1,3; 1New York University, 2Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, 3Center for Neural Science, New York University — Research employing classical conditioning paradigms has elucidated the neural systems involved in acquiring and diminishing fear responses. However, the factors that give rise to individual differences in fear acquisition and regulation are not presently well understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of individuals\\' fear-related arousal responses and their capacity to diminish these responses, might be correlated with structural differences in brain regions involved in affective processing. Two previous neuroimaging studies from our laboratory explored two methods of reducing conditioned fear, extinction and intentional cognitive regulation. We reanalyzed skin conductance response and structural MRI data from these studies to explore whether physiological measures of fear acquisition and regulation covaried with cortical thickness and volume in our regions of interest, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and the amygdala. Results showed that our physiological measures of fear acquisition in both data sets correlated with cortical thickness in a region of posterior insula. This region is thought to be critically involved in the experience and anticipation of aversive visceral stimulation. Replicating previous results (Milad et al., 2005), thickness in ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated with fear reduction via extinction. Our intentional cognitive regulation measures had no brain structure correlates. Notably, subjects’ acquisition and regulation measures were uncorrelated, suggesting that while individuals may have a structural propensity towards increased fear expression, these responses can be diminished via passive extinction learning and intentional cognitive regulation strategies. I100 THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF SOCIAL SMILES Erin Heerey1; 1Bangor University — How do humans navigate a social world in which no two interactions are the same? How do we choose which of many possible social behaviors to make? It is likely that environmental cues, such as the social cues of others, guide behavior in the social world. This hypothesis suggests that the cues we see carry information that allows us to make predictions about forthcoming social rewards. To test this idea, participants (N=10) played a game in which they chose which of two faces, presented side-by-side on a computer screen, would be “happy to be picked.” After each choice, the chosen face generated a social cue. If the face was incorrect, it frowned. If the face was correct, it smiled with either a pleasurable or a polite smile. Smile cues were predictive of the next correct answer. If the chosen face smiled pleasurably, the same face would be correct again on the next trial. If it smiled politely, the other face would be correct on the next trial. Each face was correct on 50% of trials, randomly intermixed. Participants won 2 pence for each correct answer, although they only received this non-social feedback at the end of each block. Eight of ten participants learned the reward contingency. Across all participants, smile-type predicted response to the next trial (p=.02). Additional data collection is underway. These preliminary results suggest that pleasurable and polite smiles may carry reinforce-  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  ment value in social contexts, allowing receivers to predict forthcoming rewards and serving to guide social behavior. I101 GENE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FOR COMT ON EMOTIONAL PROCESSING Martin Herrmann1, Heidi Würflein1, Theresa Schreppel1, Andreas Mühlberger1, Andreas Reif1, Klaus-Peter Lesch1, Andreas Fallgatter1; 1University of Würzburg — The interaction between genes and environment is highly relevant for our understanding of the development of psychiatric disorders. Recently it has been shown that the catechol-O-Methyltransferase genotype (COMT) modulates the brain activity during the processing of negative stimuli, but not for positive stimuli. Here we tested whether life stress, as an environmental factor, modulates this COMT genotype effect. Therefore, we measured the event-related brain potentials in 81 healthy subjects during the processing of positive and negative emotional pictures. As expected, we found that COMT modulates the neural correlates of emotional processing (the early posterior negativity, EPN), but only for negative and not for positive stimuli. Including the factor life stress we could explain this missing COMT effect for positive stimuli. We found that high and low life stress modulates the effect of the COMT genotype on the neural correlates of positive stimuli processing in contrary manner. We found that high life stress diminishes the positive evaluation of stimuli but only in subjects with the Met/Met genotype. This might be relevant for the development of depressions, as depressed patients often describe a lost of positive reinforcement.  Linguistic processes: Other I102 AN ERP STUDY OF NONWORD RHYMING IN 3- TO 5-YEAR OLDS: THE EFFECT OF AGE AND PROFICIENCY Annika Andersson1, Yoshiko Yamada1, Jessica Fanning1, Helen J Neville1; 1University of Oregon — Previous event-related potential (ERP) research of auditory rhyming showed the classical phonological rhyming effect (RE; N450) to be evident in children as young as 6 years of age (Coch, Grossi, Skendzel & Neville, 2005). ERPs to spoken nonword targets preceded by nonrhyming nonwords showed increased negativity (400-600ms post-stimulusonset) in comparison to rhyming targets, and this effect was largest at posterior medial sites bilaterally. Thus the previous research suggests that the neurocognitive networks involved in processing auditory rhyme information are comparable to adults by the age of 6. The current study extends this finding to younger children aged 3, 4 and 5 years. Behaviorally, the proportion of children with proficiency in rhyming (production and recognition skills) increased as a function of age. When comparing the RE in these age groups, no differences were found in amplitude. However, the onset of the RE decreased linearly with age. An examination of 4-year-old children with different levels of rhyming proficiency revealed similar differences in the RE. Specifically, the onset of the RE was earlier in children with rhyming skills (production and recognition) as compared to children of similar age with little rhyming skills. These results will be discussed in the framework of how phonological processing and awareness impact language and literacy development. I103 CONSONANT-SPECIFIC DIFFERENTIAL ACTIVATION IN THE SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX MAY OCCUR PREDOMINANTLY IN THE LEFT HEMISPHERE Eishi Asano1, Miho Fukuda1, Masaaki Nishida1, Robert Rothermel1, Csaba Juhasz1, Sandeep Sood1; 1Children\\'s Hospital of Michigan, Wayne State University — By measuring gammaoscillations on electrocorticography recording, we determined whether consonant-specific differential activation during speech occurred in the left, right or both primary sensorimotor lip areas in children with medically-uncontrolled focal epilepsy (age: 7-17 years), who underwent epilepsy surgery. Subdural electrodes were placed on the left hemisphere in  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  287  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  four children and on the right hemisphere in the remaining four. Subjects were asked to vocally repeat a non-semantic sound consisting of either “Fee”, “Faa”, “Hee” or “Haa” 80 times (= 20 vocalizations per each sound) in a pseudorandom sequence, and the magnitudes of eventrelated gamma oscillations were measured. Analysis of all epochs for all sounds showed that gamma oscillations were increased in the primary sensorimotor cortex for the face around the onset of vocalization in all eight patients. Comparison between epochs for vocalizing sounds with “F” and those for vocalizing sounds with “H” revealed that the primary sensorimotor lip area was activated by vocalizing “F” significantly more than vocalizing “H” in 3/4 patients with left-sided recording and in 0/4 patients with right-sided recording. The subject who showed no such consonant-specific differential activation in the left sensorimotor cortex had many erroneous responses due to poor auditory memory. Larger cortical activation in the left sensorimotor lip area during vocalizing “F” may be partially attributed to larger movement of the lip. Lack of such consonant-specific differential activation in the right hemisphere may lead to the hypothesis that lip movement associated with vocalization is predominantly driven by the left hemisphere, if intact, in humans. I104 THE EFFECTS OF CONTEXTUAL CONSTRAINT IN THE NEURAL SPECIALIZATION OF READING PROCESSES Noemi Aznar-Bese1, Arturo E. Hernandez1, Pilar Archila1; 1University of Houston — The aim of our study was to investigate how contextual cues modulate the neural specialization of reading processes in the adult brain. Twenty-four volunteers underwent fMRI scanning at 3 Tesla while they completed a silent self-paced sentence reading task. A total of 102 sentences selected from Bloom and Fishler’s “Completion norms for 329 contexts” were grouped into three experimental conditions according to the cloze probability (CP) of their target words: a high-constraint (CP>0.70), a neutralconstraint (CP 0.40-0.70) and a low-constraint condition (CP<0.40). The analysis of the functional data revealed significant differences in the BOLD response across conditions. Low-constraint sentences led to increased activation of the right MTG, STG, DLPFC, fusiform area, and MFG, bilateral IFG, and left cingulate and SFG - areas involved in language and reading processes. These results are consistent with our hypothesis of higher cognitive demands expected for low-constraint conditions. Surprisingly, the high-constraint condition led to greater activation of the left amygdala and bilateral middle cingulate – areas involved in processes of response monitoring, decision making and their inherent emotional effects. These results suggest that highly predictable contexts engage, to a greater extent, an additional continuous feedback system responsible for the self-monitoring of performance. Taken together, our results stress the need for stricter contextual control in subsequent reading studies. I105 READING VERSUS WRITING IN DEEP DYSLEXIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMMON AND INDEPENDENT LEXICON THEORIES Venu Balasubramanian1, Anna Barrett2; 1Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey, 2Kessler Medical Rehabilitation Research and Education Center, West Orange, NJ — The issue of the alleged dependency of reading and writing on oral language, an issue that was hotly debated in the classical neurology by Pitres (1884) Wernicke (1903) and Dejerine (1914), is resonated in two contemporary cognitive neuropsychological theories: The ‘common lexicon’ theory postulates that one single lexicon subserves both reading and writing (Coltheart & Funnell, 1987., Rapcsak & Beeson, 2002), whereas the ‘independent lexicon’ theory claims that the input orthographic lexicon for reading is separate from the output orthographic lexicon for writing (Rapp 2002., Rapp, Benzing, & Caramazza, 1997). These theories deserve to be investigated further because they rest on a few case studies that were inconclusive. The current study undertook an analysis of reading and writing of LK, a 45-yearold right-handed male school teacher with a stroke induced lesion in the left temporo-frontal areas. A number of tests from Psycholinguistic  288  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  Assessment of Language Processing in Aphasics (Kay, Lesser & Coltheart, 1992) were used to assess LK’s oral reading and writing. LK’s reading and writing were found to be influenced by factors such as grammatical class, imageability and word frequency, spelling regularity, non-word, and homophone. Although the near identical patterns of response in LK’s reading and writing could be construed as supportive evidence for the ‘common lexicon’ theory, the discrepancy between the presence of semantic substitutions in reading and its absence in writing would warrant a cautious interpretation. The ‘Common lexicon theory’ finds itself in an incompatible position with the numerous reports on isolated agraphias (Luzzi & Piccirilli, 2003). I106 SPORTS EXPERIENCE CHANGES THE NEURAL PROCESSING OF LANGUAGE Sian Beilock1, Ian Lyons1, Andrew Mattarella-Micke1, Howard Nusbaum1, Steven Small1; 1The University of Chicago — Sport is unlike most human activities, inspiring those who play as well as those who merely watch. For those who aspire to achieve elite performance levels, intensive practice is necessary. However, whether athletic experience carries implications beyond the playing field (i.e., beyond action perception and production) is unknown. Here we show that sports experience changes the neural basis of language comprehension – even when there is no intention to act based on the language. People with different motor skill experience rely on different cognitive and neural operations in both overt action execution (Beilock & Carr, 2001) and the comprehension of action-related language. In an fMRI study, ice-hockey players (n=12), icehockey fans (n=8), and novices (n=9) passively listened to sentences depicting ice-hockey scenarios and then performed a task that gauged understanding of spoken hockey scenarios. Participants with more hockey experience (players and fans) were better hockey language comprehenders. This relation was fully explained by increased neural activity in left dorsal premotor cortex and decreased activity in both primary sensorimotor cortices that occurred while subjects initially listened to the icehockey scenarios. We conclude that athletic experience changes language comprehension through the recruitment of neural areas involved in the selection of well-learned action plans and procedures (Toni et al., 2002; Wise & Murray, 2000) and the inhibition of neural areas known to support the explicit step-by-step control of novel movements (Rizzolatti & Luppino, 2001) – areas not traditionally involved in language understanding. This occurs because of experience performing and watching the actions in question. I107 EXPLORING INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN LATERALIZATION OF FUSIFORM ACTIVATION DURING READING Gal BenYehudah1,2, Elizabeth Tricomi4, Julie Fiez1,2,3; 1University of Pittsburgh, 2The Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, 3The Center for Neuroscience, University of Pittsburgh, 4California Institute of Technology — Reading involves a set of processing stages from visual analysis to phonological and semantic retrieval. A large body of work has identified a left fusiform region that is crucial to the perceptual analysis of word form (i.e. the visual word form area, VWFA). Readers of alphabetic scripts show strong left lateralized activation of the fusiform cortex. In contrast, readers of nonalphabetic scripts show bilateral activation of the fusiform cortex, typically associated with the perceptual demands of processing complex visuo-spatial scripts. Interestingly, variability also exists in the differential activation of left and right fusiform among readers of alphabetic scripts. To investigate the functional consequences of these individual differences, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of fMRI data collected during a visual word-pair associate learning task. For each right-handed participant, we identified the VWFA and its right homologue as reported in past studies. In these regions, we determined the amount of signal change during visual word presentation, and calculated a laterality index based on magnitude differences between activations in left and right fusiform regions. At the group level there was a significant left bias in fusiform activity, whereas individual subjects showed considerable  \\x0cPoster Session I  variability in their laterality index. We used a behavioral manipulation of word inversion (rotation by 180 degrees) to probe the behavioral relevance of these individual differences in lateralization. We found a significant relationship between larger sensitivity to word inversion and smaller laterality indices suggesting that the right fusiform is functionally important for some readers of alphabetic scripts. I108 BETWEEN LAN AND P300: MARKERS FOR DISSOCIABLE ASPECTS OF RULE PROCESSING. Angele Brunelliere1, Peter Ford Dominey2; 1FPSE, University of Geneva, 2EMC – EA 3082 – Université Lyon 2 / CNRS — The LAN, a left anterior negativity component, has been found both in language comprehension tasks, after function word that predicted the subsequent syntactic structure, and in non-linguistic tasks after function symbols predicting structural transformations to be applied to preceding symbols (Hoen & Dominey 2000). Such results led to assume that the LAN is not specific to language, but rather an ability for treating structural information in rule-governed sequences. However, it is not clear whether the LAN is related to an extraction of rules indicated by function information, or application of a structural transformation triggered by the rule. To investigate this question, we examined ERP responses after function symbols which predicted order of upcoming letters, i.e. either in alphabetical order or in inverse order but involved no structural transformation. A P300 effect was observed after function symbols. Moreover, the observed sub-components P3a and P3b were modulated by the complexity of non-linguistic sequences. Hence, the P300 effect appears sensitive to extraction of rules about upcoming symbols order. The absence of the LAN component in this experiment suggests that the LAN is not related to retrieval of rules from memory, but rather to structural transformation processing triggered by the function information. Hence, in a sentence, the function information allows the mapping of previously recognized words in non-canonical syntactic structure by structural transformations. Our experiment thus offers new insights about the processes involved in language and non-linguistic rule processing. I109 THE EFFECTS OF ANAPHOR FORM AND ANTECEDENT TYPE ON ANAPHORIC PROCESSING Sarah Callahan1, Janet Nicol2, Tracy Love1,3, Jeffrey Witzel2, David Swinney1; 1University of California, San Diego, 2University of Arizona, Tucson, 3San Diego State University — Psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic models of anaphoric processing have tended to focus on the processing of phonetically overt noun phrase anaphors; however, a recent event-related potential (ERP) study (Callahan et al., 2007) demonstrated processing variation related to the form of the anaphor (i.e. phonetically null vs. overt) and the type of antecedent phrase (i.e. noun phrase (NP) vs. verb phrase (VP)). The current study used eyetracking techniques to further investigate the effect of these factors on the processing of NP anaphors and VP anaphors. Eye-movements were recorded while participants (n = 36) read sentences involving overt NP anaphors (e.g. The rebel pursued the boat and the colonel pursued it too following for days.), overt VP anaphors (e.g. …and the colonel did it too…), or null VP anaphors (e.g. …and the colonel did too…). As a secondary manipulation, the frequency of the antecedent of the overt NP anaphor was also varied (e.g. HIGH-FREQ: boat vs. LOW-FREQ: raft). As predicted, the frequency manipulation revealed the standard effect of longer first-pass fixation times for low-frequency words. Of greater interest and consistent with the previous ERP study, both the antecedent type and the anaphor form had a significant effect on first-pass fixation times for the anaphor region (e.g. and the colonel did/did it/pursued it too). Taken together, the results of the ERP and eye-tracking studies suggest that the development of comprehensive models of anaphoric processing will benefit from further research aimed at elucidating the effects of characteristics of the antecedent and anaphor.  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I110 LANGUAGE CONTENT AND CARRIER: THE FUNCTIONAL NEURAL ORGANIZATION OF SIGN AND SIGNER IDENTIFICATION FROM POINT-LIGHT DISPLAYS Cheryl M. Capek1, Karine Gazarian1, Ruth Campbell1, Bencie Woll1, Mairéad MacSweeney2, Anthony S. David3, Philip K. McGuire3, Michael J. Brammer3; 1DCAL, University College London, 2BBSU, Institute of Child Health, University College London, 3Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London — Language perception typically involves processing information about the carrier, in addition to lexical content. In spoken language, speaker identity is conveyed by acoustic properties in voice whereas in signed language, signer identity is expressed through hand and body movements as well as visual characteristics present in full pictorial displays. Using fMRI, we studied 12 congenitally, profoundly Deaf native signers of British Sign Language (BSL) as they viewed blocks of point-light displays (PLDs) composed of signers producing BSL signs alternating with two baseline conditions (non-biological movement and still dot arrangements). PLDs were chosen to ensure that no facial or other pictorial information could aid identification. Participants viewed the stimuli in two identification experiments: 1) sign and 2) signer. Compared to the moving dot baseline, both identification tasks elicited activation in the right inferior and middle frontal gyri and temporo-parieto-occipital cortices in both hemispheres. In addition, distinct activations were observed as a function of identity task, even when differences in task difficulty (signer > sign) were accounted for in the analysis. Signer identification elicited greater activation than sign identification in the temporo-occipital cortices of both hemispheres, including the posterior STS, which has previously been shown to be involved in recognising person identity from voice and nonlinguistic PLDs. In contrast, identifying signs elicited greater activation than identifying signers in the right inferior and superior parietal lobules and superior extrastriate cortex. These findings suggest that, as for spoken language, identifying the language carrier and content in signed language relies on non-identical neural networks. I111 IS LANGUAGE-SWITCHING A MATTER OF SUBJECTIVE FREQUENCY?: AN EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS STUDY USING MASKED PRIMING Krysta Chauncey1, Jonathan Grainger2, Phillip J. Holcomb1; 1Neurocognition Laboratory, Tufts University, 2Universite de Provence — It is generally accepted that switching between languages incurs cognitive costs under most circumstances. Previous research has shown that this cognitive cost occurs during automatic lexical processes (Chauncey, Grainger, & Holcomb, in press)--e.g., an L1 prime followed by an L2 target causes an increase in the N250’s amplitude when compared to a within-language prime-target pair, whereas an L2 prime followed by an L1 target causes an increase in the N400’s amplitude when compared to a within-language prime-target pair. As this was shown in non-balanced bilinguals, these results could be due to experienced word frequency (since participants had more exposure to their L1 than their L2, all L1 items were necessarily higher frequency than any L2 items). This possibility was tested by examining “frequency-switching” effects within one language using masked priming and ERPs. Primes and targets could either be from the same frequency range (low-low, high-high) or from different frequency ranges (high-low, low-high). If the language-switching costs observed by Chauncey et al. (in press) were caused by differences in subjective frequency across L1 and L2 words, then the same pattern of effects should be observed when switching between frequency ranges as were seen when switching between languages. However, no such effects were observed. This data will be discussed in relation to earlier language-switching data to examine the root of language-switching costs.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  289  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I112 WHEN THINGS DO NOT REFER: AN FMRI STUDY Nicole Chevalier1, Edith Kaan1, Guojun He2, Yijun Liu2; 1University of Florida, Program in Linguistics, 2University of Florida — How do we analyze quantifiers in multi-sentence discourses when they do not match? Discourse processing is generally considered a right hemisphere function; however this stance is somewhat controversial, as experiments until now have not elicited consistent results. To determine what areas of the brain speakers activate and thereby gain a better understanding of discourse and quantifier processing, we designed and conducted the following fMRI experiment. Sixteen neurologically healthy, monolingual speakers of English viewed 133 sets of two-sentence trials (constructed based on the results of 3 offline pretests). Experimental sentences either had matching quantifiers or mismatched ones: Four tires were leaking some air. All four had already been patched last week. (plausible); Four tires were leaking some air. All three had already been patched last week (implausible). The first sentence of each set was presented two words at a time, for 400ms each (200ms blank in between). The first two words of the second sentence (containing the second quantifier) were presented in the same manner; the rest of the second sentence was shown word-by-word for 300ms each (separated by 200 ms blank). Subjects were then cued to respond by pressing buttons whether the two sentences were plausible or implausible together. Preliminary data from a comparison of the differential activation of the implausible versus the plausible condition supports the idea that the right hemisphere is involved in discourse processing: the right hemisphere cingulate, precentral, and postcentral gyri, as well as the left inferior parietal lobule are activated to a significant degree. I113 THE ROLE OF EXPERTISE IN LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION: HOW NEURAL ACTIVITY CHANGES WITH INCREASING EXPOSURE TO CATEGORICALLY RELATED SENTENCES Matthew Cieslak1, Ian Lyons1, Sian Beilock1; 1The University of Chicago — We are often repeatedly exposed to information about a specific category of events. For example, in a meeting or lecture, one will hear a variety of different sentences all addressing the same topic. Does neural activity underlying the comprehension of these sentences vary with increasing exposure? Furthermore, does this pattern of activation depend on the degree of prior experience we have with the topic at hand? In an fMRI study, we examined how the neural activity of expert hockey players (n=12) and hockey novices (n=9) changed as they listened to sentences about hockey-specific events and everyday events in which all participants should be experienced. While passively listening to hockey-related sentences, hockey players showed activation increases over time (i.e., after several minutes of exposure to 20 different sentences of each type randomly intermixed) in occipital and parietal regions involved in visually simulating the meaning of linguistic stimuli. Novices also showed increasing activation in these areas, but only for everyday (non-hockey) sentences. These results suggest that visual cortical areas may be sensitive to repeated processing of event-related linguistic stimuli in a given category. We interpret this finding to reflect changes in how the sentences’ meaning is understood. Moreover, these changes appear to be sensitive to one’s domain of expertise. Experts (e.g., hockey players listening to hockey-sentences or even hockey novices listening to everyday sentences) may increasingly recruit these visual areas as one hears more sentences that are about domains with which they are familiar. I114 “WHAT YOU ENCODE IS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU STORE”: AN ERP STUDY OF PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSING Sonia Cornell1, Aditi Lahiri1,2, Carsten Eulitz1; 1University of Konstanz, Germany, 2University of Oxford, England — Models of speech perception differ with respect to the question, how detailed phonological information of speech is represented in the mental lexicon. One option is not to store redundant information in order to ensure efficient processing. Alternatively, models can assume full specification of all phonological  290  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  and phonetic details in the mental lexicon. The Mismatch negativity (MMN), an automatic change detection response in the brain, which is sensitive to language-specific information, has been used to demonstrate underspecified phonological representations for isolated vowels. The present MMN-study extends these findings by using linguistically more complex stimuli.Three German vowels [e], [o], [Ø] placed in words (e.g. M[Ø]ren-M[o]ren) and identical non-words (e.g. M[Ø]ken – M[o]ken) were presented, each serving as standard and deviant. Only models assuming underspecification of phonological features predict an asymmetry of MMNs within the reversal of vowel contrasts, presented as standard and deviant. For instance, vowels like [Ø] which are assumed to be underspecified for place of articulation, cannot build up this representation when presented as standard. Consequently, they do not conflict with other vowels, which will then be reflected in reduced MMN amplitudes. Results showed exactly this asymmetry in the MMN with the largest amplitudes when the unspecified deviant [Ø] maps onto the represented standard /o/. Finding these differential MMN asymmetries for similar acoustic/phonetic differences between pairs of vowels in isolation as well as in linguistically more complex structures suggests that the brain refers to underspecified phonological representations during speech perception. I115 PHONEMIC DISCRIMINATION IN CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY Nina Davids1,2, Danille van den Brink2,3, Holger Mitterer4, Hans van Balkom1, Jan de Moor1, Miranda van Turennout1,2, Ludo Verhoeven1; 1Behavioural Science Institute, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 2F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 3Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 4Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands — Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a nonprogressive posture and motor disorder which is caused by brain damage during pregnancy, birth or first year of life. A large majority of children with CP have reading and spelling problems. If they could learn to read they would be less restricted in communicating and would have access to more learning materials. The cause of the reading and spelling problems is unclear. Precursors of learning to read may not be normally developed in children with CP. The present study investigates whether children with CP differ from age-matched controls in phonemic discrimination, a low-level precursor of learning to read. This is studied by means of an ERP study, using the mismatch negativity (MMN). The MMN reflects the brain’s automatic response to any infrequent discriminable change in a stream of auditory stimuli (Näätänen, 2003). ERPs were recorded from children with CP (range: 4-6 years old) while they passively listened to series of speech stimuli and watched a silent movie. Stimuli included standard /i/ sounds which were intermixed with three deviants /u/, /y/ and high pitch /i/, resulting in a small and large phonemic contrast and a pitch contrast. The results indicated that the children with CP showed similar effects as the control children. We conclude that children with CP do not have an impairment with respect to phonemic discrimination. Therefore, future research should focus on higher levels of learning to read. I116 CORPUS CALLOSUM AND LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATION FIBER RADIAL DIFFUSIVITY CORRELATES WITH READING ABILITY IN DYSLEXIA AND NORMAL READING Marc Dubin1, Sumit Niogi1, Aziz Ulug2, Bruce McCandliss1; 1Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, 2Weill Cornell Medical College — Radial diffusivity (RD) provides a measure of the degree to which white matter restricts diffusion of water, and has recently been shown to correlate with an important precursor skill to early reading, phonological awareness, specifically in regions of interest in the corpus callosum (CC) restricted to fibers that project to temporal lobes (Dougherty, et al 2007). The current study examines this effect by attempting to correlate Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis of RD in all the major white matter tracts with a more direct measure of  \\x0cPoster Session I  reading skill in a sample of average to reading disabled children. Replicating and extending previous findings, RD in caudal regions of the CC is correlated with reading skill. As in the previous study, this finding is anatomically specific to a caudal subregion of the CC known to project to temporal lobes. Furthermore, we find that correlation with reading skill is cognitively specific in that there is no such correlation with standardized performance on a short term working memory task. Additional regions demonstrating positive correlations between major white matter tract RD and reading skill include clusters in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and inferior longitudinal fisciculus (ILF) in the left, but not right, hemisphere. Results support recent findings suggesting that CC morphology is implicated in developmental dyslexia in a way that might specifically impact temporal lobe function and morphology, yet also suggest a role for association pathways within the left hemisphere, including longitudinal fasciculi connecting anterior and posterior brain regions. I117 EMOTIONAL VALENCE MODULATE THE PHONOLOGY PROCESSING DURING CHINESE CHARACTER READING: AN FMRI STUDY Ning Fan1, Danling Peng1; 1State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University — This study used event-related fMRI to examine if the emotional valence can impact on the phonological processing of Chinese character, and the interaction with the character frequency. A 3 (Emotional valence: negative, positive, and neutral) × 2 (Frequency: high and low) design was selected. The number of stroke, concreteness and arousal level of the emotion characters were matched among the conditions. Subjects (N=14, 8 females) viewed a series of characters and were asked to perform a rhythm decision task. The behavioral data revealed that negative and positive valence accelerated the low-frequency characters’ performance, but not for the high-frequency characters. However, high-frequency positive characters’ reaction was slower than high-frequency negative and neutral stimulus. When contrast negative with neutral characters, there was increased activation in anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, posterior area of left middle/superior temporal gyrus, as well as bilateral amygdala. Compared positive to neutral character, only under the lower threshold, greater activation was occurred in anterior cingulate cortex, left hippocampus and bilateral superior parietal gyrus. Related to highfrequency characters, low-frequency characters activated left dorsal-lateral frontal cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, and right fusiform gyrus. ROI analysis indicated that the interaction between emotional valence and frequency was significant in left inferior frontal gyrus, anterior and posterior cingulated gyrus. The result suggested that the emotional modulation on phonology processing had more efficiency in low-frequency characters. Cingulated cortex, left temporal cortex and left inferior frontal cortex, which related to attention, phonological store and retrieve respectively, were sensitive to the modulation. I118 PROSODY INFLUENCES THE LISTENER\\'S ONLINE REPRESENTATION OF THE SPEAKER\\'S THOUGHTS Evelina Fedorenko1, Lillia Cherkasskiy2, Rebecca Saxe1; 1MIT, 2Stanford University — An important factor that affects interpretation of a linguistic utterance is its prosody (a combination of extra-lexical acoustic cues). In two studies (one behavioral, one fMRI), we investigated the effects of prosody on meaning in the domain of social cognition. We manipulated the prosodic contour of the phrase “I think” in naturalistic dialogs, contrasting the version of “I think” where both words were unstressed and the version where “I” was stressed (a combination of an increase in pitch height, intensity and lengthening). Speakers use the latter prosodic contour to draw attention to their own opinions, in contrast to opinions of others. In the behavioral study, we found that people infer greater confidence of the speaker (but do not themselves form more confident opinions) when “I” is stressed. In the fMRI study we first identified brain regions that have been implicated in forming a representation of someone’s thoughts. We then compared the activation in these regions to “I think” sentences with  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  different prosodic contours. These regions show a higher response to the condition where “I” is stressed than to exactly the same sentence if both words are unstressed. These results have implications for both linguistic processing (by demonstrating that subtle prosodic manipulations can affect meaning), and for social cognition (by investigating the circumstances under which comprehenders represent a speaker’s thoughts in an on-line, naturalistic task). I119 THE LONG ROAD TO AUTOMATION: TIMING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LETTER/ SPEECH-SOUND INTEGRATION REVEALED WITH ERP. Dries Froyen1,2, Milene Bonte1,2, Nienke van Atteveldt1,2, Hanne Poelmans1,2, Leo Blomert1,2; 1Maastricht University, The Netherlands., 2Maastricht brain imaging center (M-BIC), The Netherlands — In transparent languages mastery of letter/speech-sound associations is standard within one year of reading instruction. If and how this is reflected in brain processes is currently unknown. A recent event-related potentials (ERP) study demonstrated automatic integration of letters and speech-sounds in fluently reading adults early in neural processing time (at 150 ms) [1]. Additionally, manipulating stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) revealed a narrow temporal window of integration (at 0ms SOA, not at 100 or 200ms SOA). The present study aimed to unveil when and how letter/speech-sound integration becomes automatic by employing the same ERP-paradigm with beginning (8y) and advanced (11y) readers. In an auditory oddball paradigm, speech-sounds were presented in isolation or in the context of letters appearing either simultaneous with or 200ms before the speechsound (0 or 200ms SOA). In beginning readers, the early effect of letters on speech-sound processing (at 150ms), as shown in adults, was not present. Instead, they showed a later effect (at 650ms), but only at SOA 200ms. Advanced readers showed an adult-like early effect (at 150ms), however despite four years of reading instruction, only at 200ms SOA. At 0ms SOA, only a late effect (at 650ms) was present. In sum, a double shift in timing characteristics of letter/speech-sound processing was found; in latency (from late to early) and temporal window of integration (from 200 to 0ms SOA). These results indicate extended neural development of letter/speech-sound processing, most likely caused by a reciprocal interaction between brain maturation and reading experience. [1] Froyen e.a., in press, NSL I120 SUBTYPES OF DYSLEXIA Marion Grande1, Elisabeth Bay1,2, Helen Schreiber2, Julia Tschierse1, Klaus Willmes1, Walter Huber1, Katrin Amunts1,2, Stefan Heim2; 1University Hospital Aachen, 2Institute for Neurosciences and Biophysics - Medecine, Research Centre Juelich — Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster #1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster #2 had higher attentional costs; cluster #3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. The underlying neurofunctional mechan isms are currently being investigated and will also be presented. I121 HOW DOES THE BRAIN DEAL WITH THE SYNTAX OF TWO NATIVE LANGUAGES? AN ERP STUDY IN EARLY BILINGUALS Manfred F. Gugler1, Sonja Rossi1, Angela D. Friederici1, Anja Hahne1; 1Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive & Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany — The age of acquisition of one or more languages seems to be one important  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  291  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  factor in determining how the learned languages are processed in the brain. In the present study the syntactic processing in German-Italian bilinguals was investigated with event related brain potentials (ERPs). For this purpose, a German and an equivalent Italian material were created. Each material contained four different experimental conditions, namely a correct sentence, a word category violation, a morphosyntactic violation, and a combination of both violation types. 12 German-Italian bilinguals who learned both languages in their families from birth on and thus had a very early age of acquisition participated in the EEG study. The results show the same ERP components when participants heard the German and the Italian sentences. In detail, word category violations compared to correct sentences elicited an early anterior negativity reflecting early phrase structure building processes, followed by an additional negativity probably reflecting referential integration processes and a P600 suggesting syntactic reanalysis. Results for the morphosyntactic versus correct condition show an anterior negativity indicating the processing of the morphosyntactic error followed by a P600. Finally, combined violations elicited the same ERP components as in the pure word category condition suggesting a primacy effect of word category information over morphosyntactic aspects. These findings indicate that at least when two languages are acquired very early the brain processing mechanisms are similar for both languages suggesting that both languages recruit the same underlying neuronal mechanisms. I122 THE N200 AS AN INDEX OF ORTHOGRAPHIC PROCESSING IN A REICHER-WHEELER PARADIGM Margaret M. Gullick1, Elyse George1, Priya Mitra1, Donna Coch1; 1Dartmouth College — Previous research has suggested that the N200 component of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform may index early, automatic orthographic processing. To investigate the sensitivity of the N200 to orthography, we used a variant of the Reicher-Wheeler task in an ERP paradigm. We briefly presented (40 ms) four-letter strings, followed by a mask (200 ms), then a string of four hash marks with one letter below and one letter above a given hash mark; this required a button-press response indicating which of the two letters had been presented in the masked string in that position. ERPs were recorded to the masked four-letter strings, which were real words (DARK/PARK), pseudowords (DARL/PARL), or nonwords (RDKA/RPKA); here followed by forced-choice letters D and P. In participants run to date (n = 13, half the full sample), a behavioral word superiority effect (WSE) was evident: letter choices were more accurate for words than nonwords (p < .01). A pseudoword superiority effect (PWSE) was also evident, with greater accuracy for letters in pseudowords than nonwords (p < .01). Electrophysiologically, mean amplitude of the N200 (170-220 ms) was greater for nonwords than words at posterior, right hemisphere sites (condition x hemisphere x anterior/posterior, p < .05) and was greater for nonwords than pseudowords (condition, p < .05). Our findings from a classic masked priming, forced-choice letter paradigm adapted into an ERP format are consistent with the suggestion that the N200 is sensitive to early, automatic orthographic processing in terms of both a WSE and a PWSE. I123 WHAT’S THE POINT OF GESTURES? ERPS DURING CO-SPEECH POINTING IN ABSTRACT SPACE. Thomas Gunter1, Henning Holle1, Douglas Weinbrenner1; 1Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany — An increasing number of neuroscience studies have shown that gestures can impact language comprehension. Here, we explored the effects of abstract pointing gestures. Typically, a pointing gesture indicates a certain direction, location or object. It is, however, also possible that a pointing gesture does not have a preexisting target, but is directed towards seemingly empty space. In such abstract deixis a physically empty location is assigned a meaning by virtue of being the target of a pointing gesture. For instance, when talking about pets, a speaker could refer to ‘cat’ using a left pointing gesture and to ‘dog’ by a right one. Then, by observing a pointing either to a left or right position,  292  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  all interlocutors may be able to infer which animal is referred to. While EEG was recorded, participants were presented with an interview in which a female was interviewed on 84 topics (i.e. animals: ‘What kind of pets do you like more, cats or dogs?’). By answering several topic-related questions the interviewee established abstract space (cf. left: cats, right: dogs). During the response on the last question of a particular topic, either a correct or an incorrect pointing gesture was made by the interviewee. The ERPs elicited by incorrect co-speech pointing showed an N400-like negativity between 200 and 450 ms followed by a slow positivity between 600 and 800 ms. Tentatively, we interpret the negativity to reflect difficulty of semantic integration of co-speech pointing into the speech context, whereas the positivity possibly reflects a reanalysis process. I124 ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL BRAIN ACTIVITY IN SPANISH SIGN LANGUAGE PROCESSING: EVIDENCE FOR SEMANTIC AND PHONOLOGICAL STRUCTURE. Eva Gutierrez1, Oliver Müller1, Cristina Baus1, Manuel Carreiras1; 1University of La Laguna — The present ERP study investigates lexical processing in Spanish Sign Language by means of formal and semantic priming. Studies of word recognition in spoken languages have used priming as a tool to explore the structure of word representations: Word pairs are presented that share a property of interest and performance is compared to word pairs without any relation. The assumption is that only the manipulation of properties encoded in word representations would lead to processing differences. Such priming effects have not only been found for behavioral measures, but also for the ERP. This study extends the ERP priming methodology to a signed language, testing whether overlap in phonological properties, as well as semantic characteristics, affects word recognition also in a different language format. According to the seminal work of Stokoe one can classify each sign regarding three phonological parameters: handshape, location, and movement. In three phonological experiments, critical prime-target pairs were equal regarding one particular parameter (handshape, movement, or location) while being different on the other two. In addition, we included an identity priming condition to differentiate phonological and visual-perceptual effects. A further experiment manipulated the semantic relatedness of prime-target pairs. Eight deaf native speakers and ten deaf non-native speakers participated in the experiment. Results indicate a difference in amplitude in the N400 window for the semantic manipulation, as well as for phonological manipulations involving location and movement, but not handshape. Furthermore, identity priming produced a difference in peak latency, with repeated signs showing an earlier peak than unrelated ones. I125 CORTICAL ACTIVATION EVOKED BY SPOKEN WORD FORMS AND REPETITIONS IN SLI AND DYSLEXIA Päivi Helenius1, Tiina Parviainen1, Ritva Paetau2, Riitta Salmelin1; 1Brain Research Unit, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, 2Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland — Young adults with a history of specific language impairment (SLI) differ from reading impaired (dyslexic) individuals in terms of limited vocabulary and poor verbal working memory capacity. We tracked cortical processing of spoken word forms in young adults with SLI (n=10), dyslexia (n=9), and normal language development (n=13) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The stimuli were 7-8-letter spoken real words and pseudowords, presented every 2.5 seconds. Stimuli were either repeated immediately after first presentation (75 target words/ pseudowords) or presented only once (150 filler items). The participants were instructed to listen to the stimuli and respond to proper nouns by button press. The spoken words evoked a transient peak at 100 ms (N100) followed by longer-lasting activation peaking around 400 ms (N400) in the left and right temporal cortex. The effect of lexicality (words vs. pseudowords) was detected about 400 ms onwards as activation culminated for words but continued for pseudowords. This effect was more pronounced in the left than right hemisphere in control subjects. The left  \\x0cPoster Session I  hemisphere lexicality effect was also present in dyslexic adults but was insignificant in subjects with SLI, possibly reflecting their limited vocabulary. The N400 activation between 200-700 ms was attenuated by the immediate repetition of words and pseudowords in both hemispheres. In SLI adults the repetition effect was abnormally weak between 200-400 ms after word and pseudoword onset, suggesting impaired short-term maintenance of recently activated lexical candidates in the bilateral temporal networks. The potential role of attenuated repetition effect in vocabulary growth and SLI is discussed. I126 ROUTES TO ACHIEVING LITERACY IN DEAF READERS: THE CASE OF NATIVE AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL) USERS Elizabeth Hirshorn1, Matt W.G. Dye1, Peter C. Hauser2, Daphne Bavelier1; 1Brain and Cognitive Sciences & Center for Language Sciences, University of Rochester, 2National Technical Institute for the Deaf, Rochester Institute of Technology — For hearing children, the sounds of a language play a key role in learning to read. They learn early on that the sound of the word \\'cat\\' is composed of separable sound units /k/-/a/-/t/. This \\'phonological awareness\\' is tightly coupled with reading skills in normal readers and dyslexics alike. If sounding out words is so important to young readers, how do profoundly deaf individuals, with little or no hearing in the speech range, achieve literacy? A battery of new behavioral measures was administered to deaf native signers to assess the role of phonological awareness, short-term memory, speech-reading, and ASL fluency in reading comprehension in this population. The goal was to characterize the skills that distinguish good deaf readers from poor ones. Importantly, our tests of phonological awareness were designed to detect phonological knowledge based solely on orthographic cues separately from that based on a deeper understanding of sound structure, by taking advantage of the irregularities of grapheme to phoneme correspondence in English. Tests at varying levels of analysis (e.g., phoneme, syllable, rime) also provided greater details about the profile of a good deaf reader. Finally, functional imaging during single word and sentence reading allowed us to characterize the neural networks involved in reading in the deaf, and how such networks correlate with the cognitive skills identified to support reading in the deaf. Implications for clinical populations who face difficulties learning to read through traditional instruction will be discussed. I127 LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER: INTERHEMISPHERIC COMMUNICATION IN WORD NAMING Zoe Hunter1,3, Padraic Monaghan2; 1University of Muenster, Germany, 2University of Lancaster, United Kingdom, 3Royal Holloway University of London, United Kingdom — To try and define those principles that govern interhemispheric communication, we investigated how different types of supplementary stimuli can influence processing speed in a lateralized word naming task. In order to identify information that is beneficial to processing when presented contralateral to the target word we compared five conditions in a cued visual half-field design: unilateral (____>word), bilateral length (xxxx>word), bilateral congruent (word>word), bilateral CAPITAL (WORD>word) and bilateral incongruent (foil>word). For all conditions the target was also shown in the LVF. We found a significant RVF advantage for word naming responses in all five conditions. We did not find a bilateral redundancy gain for the ‘bilateral congruent’ condition (a phenomenon that has been demonstrated in several lexical decision studies), but rather observed that the more complex the contralateral stimulus was, the slower the response times. The ‘unilateral’ and ‘bilateral length’ conditions were most beneficial, while the ‘bilateral congruent’ and ‘bilateral CAPITAL’ conditions showed a strong advantage over the ‘bilateral incongruent’ condition. We reproduced this result pattern with a lexical decision version of the same task. In both cases response times depend strongly on the lexical properties of the stimulus presented contralateral to the target, which can either inhibit or aid processing. Interhemispheric interaction and input comparison is based on letter-level information and takes place after processing of basic  Tuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  visual features. Word naming is fastest if there is no interference on a lexical level and benefits from congruent perceptual and/or lexical properties. I128 DISSOCIATING MEMORY REPRESENTATIONS FOR DISCOURSE FROM GENERAL MEMORY REPRESENTATIONS: EVIDENCE FROM ERPS Clinton L. Johns1, Peter C. Gordon3, Tamara Y. Swaab1,2; 1University of California, Davis, 2Center For Mind and Brain, University of California, Davis, 3University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill — The use of repeated name anaphora to establish coreferential relationships in discourse contexts induces processing difficulty when such anaphors\\' antecedents are names in discourse focus (e.g., John went to the store because John…\"). This repeated name penalty (Gordon et al., 1993) manifests as an N400 effect in ERP research (e.g., Swaab et al., 2004). A previous study (Johns et al., 2007) examined whether this effect of discourse prominence could be distinguished from more general memory effects by manipulating perceptual characteristics of the antecedent names (e.g., \"Alexis\" vs. \"lAexis\"). Behavioral results showed that these perceptual manipulations enhanced memory performance. ERPs timelocked to the coreferential repeated name anaphors replicated the RNP N400 effect when antecedent names did not contain a letter reversal. In addition, increased priming for repeated names with antecedents in discourse focus when the antecedent contained the perceptual manipulation was found. The present study applied this perceptual manipulation to names in unstructured word lists in order to dissociate the memorial effects of the perceptual manipulation from memorial effects of discourse focus; critical names either were repeated from an earlier instance in the list, or were not. Results reveal repetition priming effects in both conditions; these results, in concert with previous research, suggest that discourse-driven memory effects can be dissociated from the effects of general, stimulus-driven memory operations. I129 AN ERP STUDY OF CEREBRAL ASYMMETRIES FOR PROCESSING LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE MEANINGS Natalie A. Kacinik1, Johnchristopher A. Aragon1, Tamara Y. Swaab1; 1University of California, Davis — The right hemisphere has been proposed to be preferentially involved in comprehending subordinate figurative meanings (Anaki et al. 1998; Beeman, 1998; Brownell, 2000; Jung-Beeman, 2005). However, a series of behavioral divided visual field (DVF) and central ERP experiments (Kacinik & Chiarello, 2007; Kacinik et al., in preparation) have repeatedly failed to show hemispheric and N400 differences for the integration of literal and figurative meanings into ambiguous contexts. Since figurative senses are generally extended from the literal meaning, they may not engender the kind of semantic competition and selection processes typical of homonymous words like BALL. The current experiment was designed to further directly test this hypothesis by measuring ERPs to lateralized sentence-final words related to the literal or figurative sense of polysemous words in ambiguous contexts (e.g., The girl did not approach the slimy FROG / CLERK). No significant differences between the integration of literal and figurative meanings were found in either visual field with respect to both N400 and late positive effects. The more imageable literal endings, however, did show a bigger frontal imageability effect in the LVF/RH than the RVF/LH, supporting prior indications that brain activity differences in understanding literal and figurative meanings mainly reflect differences in imageability rather than the literal or figurativeness per se. Semantically incongruent endings in the LVF/ RH also resulted in a larger N400 than for the RVF/LH, providing further evidence of RH involvement in sentence comprehension and sensitivity to message-level meaning.  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  293  \\x0cTuesday, April 15, 3:00 - 5:00 pm  I130 PREFRONTAL NONVERBAL INFORMATION PROCESSING IN TRANSLATION OF VERBAL SPEECH INTO FINGER BRAILLE: A FNIRS STUDY. Takeo Kondo1, Naoyuki Okochi1, Satoshi Fukushima1; 1Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo — Deaf-blind people can talk with other people through a special communication method called finger braille. In this method, well-trained translators listen the speech, then they real-timely types six points braille expressing the speech contents directly on the deaf-blind people’s six fingers of both hands. By this method, deaf-blind people can “listen” the speech from the tactile information. Finger braille users among deafblind people say that they can feel nonverbal aspects (e.g., prosody) of vocal speech from the touch. To investigate whether translators are translating nonverbal aspects of speech into tactile information or not, we recorded touch-strength of translations by pressure sensors. And coincidently with the pressure recording, we recorded prefrontal neural activations through functional near-infrared imaging method (fNIRS) to investigate neural basis of the processing. Seven translators participated in three fNIRS sessions. One session for tasks of translating adjectives with rich emotional prosody, one for adjectives with less emotional prosody (flat intonation), and one for control tasks in which they simply typed their six fingers according to repeated sequences of beep sounds. Touch-strength of well-trained translators varied dynamically according to the prosody and their bilateral orbitofrontal region significantly activated in both translating tasks against the control task. Though it has been known that orbitofrontal region involved nonverbal processing (i.e., aprosodia) , these results also suggest that this region might also involved in inter-modality translation of prosody information. I131 BRAIN RESPONSES EVOKED BY PHONOLOGICAL, SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC PROCESSES OF AUDITORY JAPANESE Ayumi Koso1,2, Shiro Ojima3,1, Hiroko Hagiwara1,3; 1Tokyo Metropolitan University, 2Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, 3Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society — Modern linguistic theories assume that human language consists of components, such as phonology, semantics and syntax. The accumulated electrophysiological literature provides evidence for the distinctiveness of brain responses that reflect phonological, semantic and syntactic processes. Here, we report an event-related potential (ERP) study that investigated the brain responses evoked by sentences that were phonologically (PHO), semantically (SEM) or syntactically (SYN) anomalous. The present study exploited the properties of Japanese (head-final, agglutinative and pitch-accent) to control for factors, such as linear distance and morpheme type across conditions. The electroencephalogram was continuously recorded while participants listened to the PHO sentences that violated pitch-accent, the SEM sentences that contained non-words and the SYN sentences that violated a syntactic dependency. The PHO condition displayed a combination of anterior negativity and P600. The SEM condition elicited a broadly distributed N400 followed by a wide spread P600, whereas the SYN condition elicited only a P600. The anterior negativity was interpreted as reflecting phonological processes, in contrast to the N400 that reflected semantic integration difficulty. The P600 observed among all three conditions was considered as reflecting the costs of integration. Moreover, an analysis of the onset latencies of the negativities elicited by the PHO and SEM conditions revealed that the former onset latency was earlier than the latter. The present results suggest that phonological, semantic and syntactic processes are indexed by distinct electrophysiological indices and that phonological analysis occurs before semantic analysis.  294  Cognitive Neuroscience Society  Poster Session I  I132 AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN INTERLINGUAL PRIMING: AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL INVESTIGATION Shanna Kousaie1, Natalie Phillips1,2; 1Center for Research in Human Development, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, 2 Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B. Davis, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada — The available literature is inconsistent regarding the representation of a bilingual individual\\'s two languages. Some studies suggest that language access is non-selective (i.e., both languages are accessed simultaneously), while others find language access to be selective (i.e., one language is accessed preferentially). Furthermore, the aging literature suggests age-related slowing in semantic activation or processing resulting from an inhibition deficit, which limits the ability of older adults to ignore irrelevant information, causing them to rely more heavily on compensatory strategies such as context. This study examines age-related differences in bilingual language selectivity and processing using both event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and reaction time (RT) measures. Using interlingual homographs (IH, i.e., words with identical orthography in French and English but with distinct semantic features, e.g., COIN meaning \\'corner\\' in French and \\'money\\' in English) in a semantic priming paradigm we investigated the use of language context in biasing the reading of an IH towards one language. Young (n=19; M = 24.5 years) and older (n=13; M = 72 years) highly proficient French/English bilinguals were presented with triplets of letter strings comprised of a language context, an IH, and a target word, in a lexical decision task. RT data revealed no age-difference in language context use. ERP data show less widespread N400 priming in older relative to younger adults and differential priming effects based on language consistency between the language context and target word. Results will be discussed in terms of language selectivity and processing in the native and second language of bilinguals.  \\x0cAuthor Index  Index  A Aarts, E 235 Abbadessa, C 230 Abe, N 130, 132,
