       "'E 129 TEMPORAL PROPERTIES OF MONOCULAR AND DICHOPTIC CROWDING Paul F. Bulakowski, Robert B. Post, David Whitney; University of California, Davis — Identification of an object in the peripheral visual field is impaired when it is crowded by surrounding, nonoverlapping objects. Several studies have reported two unique characteristics of crowding. First, optimal crowding for binocularly presented stimuli occurs with very brief stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs); thus  \\x0cPerceptual Processes: Other  the crowding effect is temporally dependent. Second, crowding occurs when a target and its flankers are both presented to one eye (monocular presentation) or when each is presented to a different eye (dichoptic presentation). Thus, crowding may occur at a single stage in the visual system. To test this, we measured the temporal dependence of crowding when the target and flanker stimuli were presented monocularly or dichoptically. A method of constant stimuli task revealed that crowding varied as a function of the target-flanker SOA for both monocularly and dichoptically presented stimuli. Crowding across conditions was optimal at an SOA of ~25 ms and there was a slight (~10-15 ms) asynchrony in the time courses of monocular and dichoptic crowding. The magnitude of crowding was ~30% greater for monocular than dichoptic crowding at 0 SOA. Crowding’s unique time course rejects flash suppression, rivalry as well as metacontrast, pattern, and object substitution masking as explanations for the results. Our data suggest that crowding operates over a relatively broad temporal window and raise the intriguing possibility that there are independent monocular and binocular stages of crowding.'"
