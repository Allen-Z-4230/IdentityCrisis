The four speakers will provide an update on\\ndifferent aspects of decision making in macaques and humans. Murray\\nand Rich will unravel the neural substrates and neural mechanisms\\nunderlying object choices in macaque monkeys. Murray will discuss\\nthe causal contributions of different frontal cortex areas to object\\nchoices, focusing on the complementary roles for orbital and ventral\\nprefrontal regions. Rich will discuss a novel approach to decode value\\nrepresentations from orbitofrontal cortex during individual choices with\\nhigh temporal resolution. Cisek will present the novel hypothesis that\\ndecisions about actions unfold as a biased competition, and then will\\ntest that idea using neurophysiological approaches in macaques.\\nBased on findings from both functional imaging and effects of brain\\ndamage, Kable will discuss the separable contributions of\\nventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex to decision\\nmaking in humans.\\nTALK 1: FROM KNOWLEDGE TO ACTION: THE ROLE OF THE\\nPRIMATE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX\\nBetsy Murray1; 1National Institute of Mental Health\\nThe orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), traditionally defined as Walker’s areas\\n11, 13 and 14, has long been thought to play a critical role in behavioral\\nflexibility, including behavioral inhibition and the regulation of emotion.\\nRecent evidence has overturned these ideas by showing that\\ninadvertent damage to fiber pathways account for the reported deficits.\\nThe use of a more selective lesion method in macaque monkeys has\\nshown that OFC has a more specific and different function:\\nrepresenting and updating the value of specific expected outcomes,\\nbased on current biological states. These updated valuations, in turn,\\nguide choice behavior. Recent studies have identified functional\\nsubdivisions within OFC and helped to differentiate it from nearby\\n20\\n\\nCognitive Neuroscience Society\\n\\nareas. In one study we found that the posterior part of OFC, area 13,\\nis necessary for its value updating function, while the anterior part,\\narea 11, translates this knowledge into adaptive actions. In a second\\nstudy we contrasted the contributions of OFC and the neighboring\\nventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC; Walker’s area 12) to value\\nupdating. We found that OFC and VLPFC play complementary roles\\nin value updating and—by extension—decision making. The former\\ndepends on dynamic internal states; the latter depends on dynamic\\nexternal contingencies. Given that granular OFC and VLPFC emerged\\nduring the evolution of primates, a comparative analysis suggests that\\nthese capacities built on OFC functions inherited from early mammals.\\nTALK 2: DYNAMIC ENCODING OF CHOICE IN THE\\nORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX\\nErin Rich1,2; 1University of California Berkeley, 2University of\\nCalifornia San Francisco\\nWhen making a subjective decision, it is believed that the brain\\ncomputes a value for each option and compares these values to arrive\\nat a choice. Evidence suggests that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is\\ncritically involved in this process, however the neural mechanisms\\ninvolved remain largely obscure. One reason is that preferences are\\nfrequently driven by knowledge and states internal to the organism,\\nand far removed from externally observable sensory inputs or motor\\noutputs. Furthermore, subjective decisions are not stereotyped. They\\nmay evolve differently even if the same decision is made multiple\\ntimes, so that averaging neural responses over repeated trials can\\nobscure critical detail. With this in mind, we used a novel approach to\\ndecode value representations from OFC during individual choices with\\nhigh temporal resolution. Ensembles of OFC neurons and field\\npotentials were recorded while non-human primate subjects chose\\nbetween images that predicted rewards of different value. We used a\\nclassification algorithm to decode patterns of activity associated with\\neach image, and found that OFC alternated between states\\nrepresenting the value of two choice options. The decoded patterns\\nvaried trial-by-trial, but the strength and frequency of the recovered\\nstates predicted whether a subject would decide quickly or vacillate\\nbetween the two alternatives. Multiple neural features contributed to\\nthese representations, and individual neurons were found to shift their\\nfiring rates as the network evaluated each option. Overall, dynamic\\n\\n\\x0c2017 Annual M eeting\\n\\nrepresentations of value in OFC are likely a fundamental feature of\\nlarge-scale brain networks that underlie value-based decision-making.\\nTALK 3: NEURAL MECHANISMS OF REAL-TIME EMBODIED\\nDECISIONS\\nPaul Cisek1; 1University of Montreal\\nPsychological and neurophysiological studies of decision-making have\\nfocused primarily on scenarios in which subjects are faced with\\ndiscrete options that are stable in time, permitting a serial process of\\nrepresenting the relevant information, careful deliberation about the\\nchoice, followed by action planning and execution. However, the brain\\nevolved to guide interactions with a dynamic and constantly changing\\nworld, in which the choices themselves as well as their relative costs\\nand benefits are defined by the momentary geometry of the immediate\\nenvironment and are continuously changing during ongoing activity.\\nSuch “embodied decisions” still dominate our lives, whether we’re\\nplaying a sport or walking through a crowd, and they pose challenges\\nthat are very different than the demands of economic choice. To deal\\nwith these challenges, animals require a neural architecture in which\\nthe sensorimotor specification of potential actions, their valuation,\\nselection, and even execution can all take place in parallel. I will\\ndescribe a general hypothesis for how the brain deals with the\\nchallenges of such dynamic and embodied behavior, and present a\\nseries of neurophysiological recording experiments in rhesus monkeys\\naimed at testing the predictions of this hypothesis. These experiments\\nsuggest that decisions about actions unfold as a biased competition\\ntaking place within a map of potential actions and that the resolution\\nof this competition, in the sensorimotor system, is what determines the\\nvolitional commitment to an action choice.\\nTALK 4: VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX PLAYS A\\nSIMILAR ROLE IN TEMPORALLY-EXTENDED FORAGING-STYLE\\nDECISIONS AND BINARY CHOICES\\nJoseph Kable1; 1University of Pennsylvania\\nMany decisions involve choosing whether to continue pursuing a\\ncurrent goal or abandon this course of action in favor of an alternative\\none. Foraging is a classic example of such sequential, temporallyextended decision making. There has been much debate about\\nwhether the neural mechanisms of temporally-extended decisions,\\nsuch as foraging, are fundamentally similar to those of choices from a\\nfixed menu of options. To address this question, we performed a series\\nof studies using a willingness-to-wait paradigm, in which people\\ncontinually reassess whether they want to keep waiting for a\\ntemporally uncertain delayed reward. We find that waiting behavior in\\nthis task is well described by formal models of optimal foraging. Using\\nfMRI, we find that neural activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex\\ntracks the value of the awaited reward as it dynamically changes\\nthrough time, akin to the static value signal previously observed in this\\nregion during discrete choices from a fixed menu. Damage to the\\n\\nI nvit ed Sym pos ium\\n\\nventromedial prefrontal cortex in humans also impairs the calibration\\nof waiting, in the same way that damage to this region impairs the\\nconsistency of binary choices. In contrast to the results in ventromedial\\nprefrontal cortex, we find that anterior cingulate cortex and anterior\\ninsula exhibit increased activity right before decisions to abandon the\\ncurrent option, and interpretation of this as a signal to shift strategy is\\nbolstered by the finding that lesions here enhance waiting. These\\nresults argue for a continuity in the role of frontal cortex across different\\nforms of decision-making.\\nQ&A PERIOD\\nThe speakers will take questions from the audience.\\n\\nInvited Symposium Session 2\\nCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS IN HEARING, SPEECH, AND\\nLANGUAGE\\nSunday, March 26, 10:00 am - Noon, Ballroom B/C\\nChair: David Poeppel, Max-Planck-Institute, NYU\\nSpeakers: Saskia Haegens, Virginie van Wassenhove, Nai Ding,\\nDavid Poeppel\\nNeural activity of an oscillatory nature is observed in a range of studies\\ninvestigating perception and cognition. There is legitimate debate\\nabout the role of oscillations, but on balance there is emerging\\nconsensus that cortical oscillations play a critical role in shaping the\\ntemporal structure of perceptual experience. One area of research in\\nwhich new theories and approaches are being explored concerns their\\npotential causal role for hearing speech, and language processing.\\nFrom selecting information in auditory streams to recognizing the\\nelements of speech to constructing abstract linguistic representations,\\noscillations across timescales (from low-frequency delta to activity in\\nthe high-gamma band) have been implicated in functionally specific\\nways. The symposium addresses major new phenomena and their\\npotential explanations by drawing on psychophysics and\\nneurophysiology (MEG, ECoG, EEG).

Subjects performed an auditory discrimination task, in which\\nthey received a temporal visual cue, which was either informative\\n(rhythmic condition) or not informative about the specific timing of the\\ntarget (random condition). We showed that when a target is presented\\nin-phase with the cued rhythm, performance improves as compared to\\nboth the random-mode (no precise temporal information) and the outof-phase (unexpected) condition. In an accompanying MEG study we\\nlooked into the neural correlate of this effect, and found increased delta\\ncoherence, in the rhythmic condition, which was sustained after the\\ncue, confirming the entrainment prediction.\\nTALK 2: TIMING SPEECH CONTENT\\nVirginie van Wassenhove1; 1CEA/NeuroSpin, France\\nNeuronal oscillations have been implicated in various cognitive\\nfunctions including time and speech processing. Non-stationarities in\\nthe phase and in the power of entrained brain responses are not only\\ncritical to index the endogenous control of information processing but\\nalso to capture an individual’s subjective perception of time or speech\\ncontent. For instance, using a temporal recalibration paradigm in which\\nparticipants adapted to audiovisual asynchronies while being recorded\\nwith magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed that changes in the\\nphase of the auditory entrained responses could predict an individual’s\\nconscious event timing. In the speech domain, neuronal oscillations\\nhave been hypothesized to segment the acoustic stream into\\ncomputational units (e.g. syllables or words). To test whether parsing\\nwas driven by bottom-up acoustic cues or modulated by top-down\\nrepresentational availability, participants listened to speech streams\\nthat would yield two possible percepts. Two markers of neural-speech\\ntracking were found under endogenous control: small modulations in\\nlow-frequency oscillations and variable latencies of high-frequency\\nneural activity (sp. beta and gamma bands). While changes in lowfrequency neural oscillations were compatible with the encoding of\\npre-lexical segmentation cues, high-frequency activity informed on an\\nindividual’s conscious speech percept. Altogether, these results are\\nconsistent with the notion of neural oscillations as cortical framing of\\ninformation processing in time.\\nTALK 3: CORTICAL TRACKING OF HIERARCHICAL LINGUISTIC\\nSTRUCTURES IN CONNECTED SPEECH\\nNai Ding1; 1Zhejiang University, China\\nLanguage is hierarchically organized into syllables, words, phrases,\\nand sentences. For spoken language, online building of these\\nhierarchical linguistic structures is a fundamental yet challenging task.\\nAlthough the boundaries between syllables generally have clear\\nacoustic signatures, determining the boundaries between words and\\n\\n22\\n\\nC ognitiv e N eurosc ience Society\\n\\n2017 Annual M eet ing\\n\\nphrases critically relies on the listener's linguistic knowledge. During\\nspeech listening, it has been well characterized that auditory cortical\\nactivity is entrained to the syllabic rhythm of speech. However, how\\nlarger linguistic structures, such as words and phrases, are\\nrepresented in the brain remains elusive and is investigated in this\\nstudy. We designed speech materials in which the hierarchical\\nlinguistic structure of speech is dissociated from low level acoustic\\nfeatures,\\nand\\nmeasured\\ncortical\\nactivity\\nusing\\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG) from listeners listening to such\\nmaterials. It is demonstrated that cortical activity is concurrently\\nentrained to the rhythms of syllables, phrases, and sentences,\\nunconfounded by the tracking of acoustic properties of speech.\\nFurthermore, entrainment to larger linguistic structures such as\\nphrases and sentences is demonstrated to be associated with the\\nsyntactic structure of speech rather than the predictability of each\\nincoming word. In summary, cortical circuits can generate slow\\nrhythms matching the time scales of larger linguistic structures, even\\nwhen such rhythms are not present in the speech input, which provides\\na plausible mechanism for online building of large linguistic structures.\\nTALK 4: CORTICAL RHYTHMS IN HEARING, SPEECH, AND\\nLANGUAGE: A TAXONOMY\\nDavid Poeppel1,2; 1Max-Planck-Institute, 2NYU\\nOscillations have been observed in a wide range of phenomena in\\ncognition, in general, and language processing, in particular. The\\nrumors about oscillations range from ‘they are causally crucial’ to ‘they\\nare at most the exhaust fumes of cortical computation.’ Can the\\nwilderness of oscillation-based phenomena be tamed? On the view\\nthat brain rhythms are not merely epiphenomenal but play some role,\\nan attempt at a taxonomic model is made. I argue that oscillations\\nacross rates can be argued to sample, predict, and attend to the world.\\nMost broadly speaking, the pairing of theta and gamma underlies\\nsampling, the pairing of delta and beta underlies predicting, and alpha\\nsplits the low and high rhythm regimes and underlies attending and\\ninhibiting the inputs that confront our perceptual and cognitive\\nsystems.\\nQ&A PERIOD\\nThe speakers will take questions from the audience.\\n\\nInvited Symposium Session 3\\nTHE LAPSING BRAIN: HOW ATTENTIONAL\\nFLUCTUATIONS IMPACT COGNITION\\nTuesday, March 28, 1:30 - 3:30 pm, Ballroom A\\nChair: Edward Vogel, University of Chicago\\nSpeakers: Kirsten C.
